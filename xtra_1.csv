Is representation in parliament limited to just voting?? How about Chairmen of Parliamentary Committees who do not have original votes but casting votes only in events of equality of votes as provided in Order 211 of our parliamentary standing orders?? Is the SC declaring this provision too unconstitutional? How about Article 104(5) which provides that members of parliament who are parties to firms which is a party to a contract with the Government shall declare their interests and shall not vote on any question relating to them in parliament?? Is this provision too unconstitutional since the voting right of these categories of MPs is also prohibited by that?2. How does this ruling uphold the tenets of the cardinal principles of separation of powers?? Doesn’t this ruling amount to an unholy invasion of parliament by the judiciary?? Is the judiciary not directing and remote controlling how parliamentary proceedings should be conducted?? What happens to Article 110 of the Constitution 1992 which provides that Parliament may by standing orders regulate its own procedure?? I can’t wait for an official reaction by the speaker of parliament who is the head of the legislative arm of government. If the parliament will sit and allow a daylight usurpation of their powers as an equal authoritative arm of government by another arm of government, then fine, so be it?? I think, however, that, this unbridled invasion of an arm of government into the operations of another arm of government is fundamentally wrong, democratically unethical; it is unconstitutional and must be resisted forcefully by the latter. This is a judicial coup d’état on the legislature.3. Will deputy speakers of our parliament still enjoy the respect and privileges they hitherto enjoyed under this constitution prior to this ruling?? Will they not be treated as typical partisans like other ordinary members of parliament when they preside?? Will they not struggle to preside over government businesses in the absence of the speaker?? I am surprised this is a unanimous decision by the apex court of our land. What mischief and (or) purpose at all does this ruling seek to remedy?? Well, let the implementation start, and let’s see how our legislative arm of government will look like.4. What happens to the principle of non-justiciable political question doctrine which is firmly revered within Ghanaian jurisprudence as was held in the case of Tuffour v. AG and GBA v AG which prohibits the court from entertaining matters that explicitly textually demonstrate commitment to a coordinated political department i.e the legislature or the executive?? In Tuffour v AG, the Court reasoned that the courts do not and cannot inquire into how parliament went about its business. It further added that actions within parliament are a close book. I understand the SC is equally a master of their own rules and can overturn their previous decisions as and when necessary; this however cannot be done in obvious arbitrariness as this appears to be.5. Yes, the SC may be fully sheltered in their exercise of exclusive interpretation powers as provided for in Article 2(1) and 130(1) of the Constitution 1992, the exercise of the same however regarding admissibility of political issues must be in tandem with the wisdom as provided for in Article 296 of this same Constitution. This ruling in my opinion is an own goal for Ghana in our strife to stabilize the seeming/real political turbulence in the country.6. I hear the AG is advocating for a re-run of the election in Buem Constituency to include/involve the people of SALL.7. It is obvious this comedy won’t stop anytime soon. The SC of Ghana is sinking so fast.Call our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",Peter Suaka Writes: The Judicial Coup D’état On Legislature,"Frank A.

Here are five key facts about her life and situations leading to her death. Mary lived with her father and step-mom Elizabeth Agyapong, but her natural mother lived in Agogo in the Asante Akyim North Municipality of the Ashanti region of Ghana.She joined her father in Britain to finish her education when she was a teenager. The late Ms Agyapong, affectionately called MaryMo, went to school in Wellingborough before attending University in Luton to study nursing.She worked as a general nurse for five years at Luton and Dunstable University Hospital prior to her untimely death.Mary’s father, Stephen Agyapong died of suspected coronavirus just two weeks before his daughter, family sources have told local media.He reportedly had an underlying high blood pressure which aggravated his situation after contracting the novel coronavirus.Mr Agyapong had been a teacher in Ghana but took on manual work after travelling to seek greener pastures in Europe.Before she died, Mary had been working on ward 12 of the Luton and Dunstable hospital – which has since become a Covid-19 ward.It is still not clear how and when she caught the virus, but authorities say they did not have any coronavirus patients at Luton and Dunstable Hospital before the 28-year-old took maternity leave on March 12, when she was 28 weeks pregnant.The young nurse is survived by her husband, Ernest Boateng and two children, a three-year-old son AJ and the new born Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong.Test results of her newborn baby has not been released but Ms Agyapong’s husband is currently self-isolating and has also been tested for COVID-19.A fundraising appeal launched in memory of Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong raised over GH1.2million (approximately £170,000) within the first 48 hours, exceeding initial target by 8,500 percent.The GOFUNDME campaign initiated by three of Mary’s friends, Rhoda Asiedu, Gloria Gyan and Wendy Addai, aims to generate seed money for a trust fund in support of her immediate family.",MaryMo: 5 Unknown Facts About Ghanaian Nurse Who Died of Coronavirus in UK,Fiifi Dixon,2020/04

But polls indicate that nearly seven in 10 Greeks oppose the accord, and many accuse Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of pulling his party away from its populist roots while ramming through a deal that has won him acclaim from abroad.The dispute over Macedonia’s name has burned for nearly three decades, since the country was formed in the rubble of Yugoslavia’s collapse. The name issue may seem obscure, but it had become a proxy for a wider debate over national identity in a region with a proud and deep history that dates back to Alexander the Great.The outcome Friday was cheered by pro-Europeans as a rare victory for a continent dealing with the spread of nationalism and the chaos of Britain’s pending departure from the bloc. The vote was also a blow to Russia, which had allegedly tried to tried to stoke opposition to the name deal with a disinformation campaign and by offering money and bribes.The agreement was orchestrated by a pair of left-leaning leaders, Tsipras and Macedonia’s Zoran Zaev, who faced fierce political fights in recent months and who were accused of betraying their countries’ interests. On the way to finalizing the deal, Tsipras’s ruling coalition broke apart, and he only narrowly survived a no-confidence vote.“They had imagination, they took the risk, they were ready to sacrifice their own interests for the greater good,” European Council president Donald Tusk wrote on Twitter. “Zoran, Alexis – well done! Mission impossible accomplished.”Ancient Macedonia encompassed a broad area and today an area of northern Greece is also known as Macedonia. Greece, before this vote, referred to their northern neighbor as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, or FYROM. Some Greeks say that Macedonians are making unjust claims over Greek territory or heritage.Read moreMacedonia agrees to a new name, ending a 27-year dispute with GreeceAnalysis: After 27 years, Greece and Macedonia have resolved their contentious ‘naming dispute.’ Here’s how.Today’s coverage from Post correspondents around the worldLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign newsThis story was originally published by Washington Post via: USAHintCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to info@ghanaxtra.com and we'll surely put them online","Greece approves Macedonia name change, ending 28-year row",GhanaXtra,2019/01

He fought openly and passionately against oppression, racism, poverty and homophobia.Born in Klerksdorp in 1931 and having studied teaching and theology, Tutu became increasingly active in the fight against apartheid as a young man and rose to worldwide fame during the 1980s as a vocal opponent of the apartheid system.In 1984 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.By 198,6 Tutu had become the first black person to lead the Anglican Church in Southern Africa and used his position to fight for peace and justice.After South Africa finally held its first democratic elections, Tutu was appointed chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) set up to deal with the atrocities of apartheid.In the years after the TRC ended, Tutu continued to speak out on moral and political issues.In 2007 he helped found The Elders – a grouping of senior world leaders who work together for peace and human rights.In 2009, when Jacob Zuma was about to become President of South Africa, the Arch was candid about not looking forward to his presidency. When the Dalai Lama was forced to cancel his trip to South Africa in 2011 because of controversial visa delays, Tutu again lashed out at the government and the ANC.His criticism of the state saw the Arch sidelined when his lifelong friend and world icon Mandela died in 2013 and he was not asked to speak at his funeral. A year later, Tutu made it clear he would not vote for the ruling party in South Africa’s fifth democratic elections.Tutu is survived by his wife Leah, four children, and seven grandchildren.Source: ewn.co.zaCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",Breaking News: Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu Dies At Age 90,Staff Writer,2021/12

Joshua revealed that the crisis “is getting to its peak and “will go the way it came.”He maintained that the pandemic is the result of an “error in advanced technology,” and that “its real origins have to do with mistakes in critical international research” led by governments.“Coronavirus is an issue of the governments”…… “In today’s world, warfare is no longer about physical weapons; this is one of the silent but devastating weapons of the contemporary world,” he observed.The powerful man of God cautioned that, what would follow the current crisis maybe extreme hardship which is more ravaging than the coronavirus contagion and therefore world leaders should open up their economies to avert further crisis.“Finally, ‘hardship virus’ is more dangerous than coronavirus. The presidents of the nations should open up the economy. The more we delay in opening up the economy, the more we will face a worse situation afterwards,” he concluded.﻿",T.B.

In the absence of an extra microphone for the MP, he was permitted to take off his mask so as to be heard.After the initial first two questions, lawyers for Anas sought leave of the court to confer with lawyer for Kennedy Agyapong.Though the two lawyers spoke undertone, Kennedy Agyapong’s lawyer retorted “just go ahead and do your cross-examination”.But on resumption of the cross-examination, it was noticed that Mr. Agyapong wasn’t feeling well and his discomfiture could be seen from his facial expression and sitting posture.As Mr. Agyapong continued to exhibit signs of agony from his sitting posture and demeanour in court, lawyers for Anas intimated to the judge that they would want to make an observation to the court.Lawyers for Anas then intimated to the court that since the start of the proceedings of the day, they had observed that it appears Mr. Agyapong was in pain of a sort.They added that Mr. Agyapong makes excruciating gestures from his seat. Anas’ lawyers told the court that from the demeanour and state of Mr. Agyapong, if he was unwell, then the case should be adjourned.In addition, Mr. Agyapong kept on visiting the washroom every few minutes before the case was called for hearing.The learned judge upon hearing the observation made by lawyers for Anas directed both lawyers to approach the bench.Mr. Agyapong’s brother who is also his lawyer, predicting what the judge may want to discuss with both lawyers, upon reaching where Mr. Agyapong was seated was heard asking Mr. Agyapong whether he (the lawyer) should agree to the imminent adjournment.Mr. Agyapong in an and excruciating tone was heard saying “adjourn adjourn adjourn”.The astute judge, His Lordship Eric Baah, after conferring with both lawyers for a while, announced in court that the proceedings of the day had been adjourned on health grounds.Asked when the case could continue, Kennedy’s lawyer said “My Lord I can’t tell”!As Mr. Agyapong was unable to indicate to the court when he would return from his medical treatment.

Yes NDC benefited from the 1981 coup. The PNDC rebranded itself into NDC. So one must not be surprised when key personalities of the NDC cry out for coup. They see it as one of the easiest opportunity to come back into government.Probably, the NDC know very well that, Ghanaians do not see them as a better alternative to the NPP. They do not see how they can be in government come 2024 which is just about 2 years away.Why can’t the NDC get out there and show Ghanaians what they would do, when given the opportunity? Give alternatives if you have any better solutions than what the incumbent government is doing.Probably, the NDC must be frustrated with the Mahama ticket but cannot have any better candidate to present for the 2024. So they cry for coup.Probably, those in NDC calling for COUP are saying John Dramani Mahama is not an option any more and must step aside.Probably, those calling for coup and are not members of the NDC are tired of the NDC and the NPP duopoly. If that is so and genuinely so, why not come together to form a new political party and proffer better solutions?The fix the country movement had the support of a lot of Ghanaians until some known NDC faces got involved with their activities. The movement was really picking up with a lot of Ghanaians. But they became partisan. It became clear that the leaders were doing the bidding of some politicians.The way forward for Ghana, if we genuinely think the NPP and NDC have failed us all, then those individuals must come out boldly to form a different political party, but not to incite the military to take over the reign of government.What is clear is that, the NDC is not better alternative to the NPP, even with JDM, they look scary. Probably the NDC must have a new candidate but they themselves know that JDM had captured the party with money and not policies.Probably, the various NPP flagbearer hopefuls….must step up their game on their personal level in dealing with specific topical issues even if it runs parallel to what the government is doing. They must also come out with alternative solutions publicly, especially, when the government is not ready to listen to their views in cabinet.We need to give the citizens hope but not desperation. Majority of Ghanaians are currently in despair. Some are disappointed but that not warrant a cry for coup.The media should not whip the interest for coup, but rather, call on those who have officially declared their intention to contest for the 2024 presidential elections to come out with practical alternative solutions to what His Excellency, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, is currently doing.Civil Society Organizations must rise to the occasion and create platforms for presidential hopefuls to deliberate on various alternatives.The 4th Republican Constitution must not be overthrown but rather be celebrated. It is the most successful constitution ever since colonial rule.Probably, the constitutional review process which was abandoned by JDM after the demise of president John Evans Atta Mills must be reconsidered so that we can improve on the gains so far.Coup is not an alternative.Happy 65th Anniversary.May God bless our homeland Ghana!Henry Osei Karikari

It works like magic.So whenever you see women investing energy, time and money into selecting and acquiring the ‘magic’ colors and designs to wear, the reasons are not far fetched.Call our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",Why Do Ghanaian Ladies Wear Waist Beads?

This was known to President Rawlings. On the Congress day, Bede and other party members formed a human chain on the two sides of the entrance to the Congress Hall to provide a kind of protection for the VVIP as they entered. The crowd was very thick and it was not easy to see whatever was happening at the entrance. As Bede tells it, When Rawlings and his entourage got the entrance and the crowd surged to acknowledge their hero, Rawlings got hold of his(Bede’s) testicles and squeezed them hard, so hard that he believes he fainted. When he recovered, he was outside the Congress Hall and people were fanning him. Those people did not know what had happened to him; they only knew that he had fainted”. Call our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",Working With Rawlings: Professor Ahwoi Details How Rawlings Squeezed Bede Ziedeng’s Testicles,"Frank A.

I have provided, so far, seventeen (17) updates, which have demonstrated the co-ordinated approach we initiated towards winning the battle against the pandemic. We can safely say that the benefits are showing.During my last update, a month ago, we had a total of five hundred and seven (507) active cases. Forty-five thousand, two hundred and fifty-eight (45,258) persons had recovered, and two hundred and ninety-seven (297) persons had, unfortunately, died.As at Friday, 16th October, the number of active cases has declined further to three hundred and ninety-eight (398), with forty-six thousand, six hundred and sixty-four (46,664) persons fully recovered from the virus, putting our recovery rate at 98.5%.Thirteen (13) more deaths have occurred, bringing the total number of deaths, tragically, to three hundred and ten (310), out of a total number of five hundred and ten thousand, and seventy-four (510,074) persons tested. The rate of death, 0.5%, continues to remain very low.When you take a close look at the measures some other countries are having to take, including imposing night-time curfews and partial lockdowns, declaring state of emergencies, limiting the numbers of people permitted at public gatherings, and mandatorily fining persons for not wearing masks, all in the bid to contain the secondwave of the virus, we, in Ghana, have been spared all these developments and restrictions. We must, thus, be doing something right.In fact, our favourable situation at the moment is thanks to the effectiveness of Government policies, the co-operation of you, the Ghanaian people, and, ultimately, to the grace of God.The science and data tell us that the trajectory of the virus in Ghana mirrors that of an epidemic with reduced disease activity. Our daily infection rates are no longer in the hundreds as they were sometime back. Presently, they are in the tens, averaging twenty-five (25) new cases per day, in the course of last week.This is in sharp contrast with what is happening in the countries that are experiencing a second wave of infections, where, in some instances, new infections and hospitalizations are, sadly, in the thousands per day.In spite of our successes, I would like to reiterate that this virus remains something of a mystery, and we should always rather err on the side of caution, and continue to observe the protocols that have brought us to where we are.As President of the Republic, I assured you of my continuing commitment to limiting and stopping the importation of the virus, containing its spread, providing adequate care for the sick, slowing down community spread, reducing the impact of the virus on social and economic life, and using the opportunity afforded by this pandemic to expand our domestic production capacity, and deepen our self-reliance. I remain committed to these objectives, and I will not stray from them.Fellow Ghanaians, we all know that the emergence of the virus on our shores came from abroad, necessitating the closure of our borders, by land, air and sea, in March 2020. Following the provision of testing facilities, which ensure the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 testing, Kotoka International Airport was reopened on 1stSeptember 2020.It has been six (6) weeks since the reopening, and a total of thirty thousand, five hundred and sixty-four (30,564) passengers have been tested, from which ninety-two (92) have tested positive.All ninety-two (92) are asymptomatic cases, whose status, but for the test, would not have been detected, and would have spread the disease amongst the rest of the population. I am aware that some are calling for Government to extend the PCR negative test period before boarding the flight from three (3) days to at least five (5) days.I believe, in the context of the second wave of infections that is engulfing so many countries of Europe and America, that we have to insist on the three (3) day period. It is better to be safe than sorry.Indeed, across the country, Government has seen to the expansion of COVID-19 testing facilities, from the initial (2) to sixteen (16), which include those of private sector providers.Additionally, some hospitals across the country have been equipped with the capacity to test for COVID-19. We now have more dedicated treatment facilities for dealing with the disease, and have also improved considerably the availability of PPEs for our health workers. It is reassuring that we no longer have news of shortages or lack of PPEs.Through a public-private partnership, our nation is the beneficiary of a one hundred (100) bed Infectious Diseases Centre, located at the Ga East Municipal Hospital, with plans in the offing to replicate it in Kumasi, Takoradi and Tamale.In as much as we currently have no patients at the isolation centres, I express the gratitude of the nation, once again, to private and religious bodies, who provided their facilities to support the fight. These laudable efforts have manifested the collective will of the majority of Ghanaians to rally together, irrespective of ethnic, religious or partisan political considerations, to help win this fight.It is important for me to stress that the cost of providing for the care of most persons stricken with the virus is being borne by Government, ensuring that persons who tested positive, and were in need of healthcare, received it promptly.The strategic, controlled, progressive, safe easing of restrictions continues, with its over-arching objective being to restore our lives and economy back to normal. SHS 2 and JHS 2 students are back in school, as are some students in tertiary institutions and colleges.Indeed, the academic year for new and continuing University students will commence from January 2021. Football, the passion of the nation, will return in two-weeks; private burials, still, with a maximum of one hundred (100) persons, are being performed; and the limit on the numbers of persons who can attend conferences, workshops, and award events, has been lifted, subject to the strict adherence of Covid-19 protocols.On the economic front, according to the Bank of Ghana, the Ghanaian economy is recovering faster than initially anticipated. Consumer confidence is bouncing back strongly, and is today above pre-lockdown levels.Business confidence has also increased, reflecting the improving macroeconomic conditions, stability in the exchange rate, lower input prices, moderation in lending rates, and positive industry prospects. Consumer spending, industrial consumption of electricity, and construction activities have all reached pre-lockdown levels, whilst tourist arrivals and port harbour activity are gradually edging upwards.So, I urge all of you, my fellow Ghanaians, to continue to comply with the strict hygiene, mask-wearing and social distancing protocols that have become part of our daily routines. This is the surest way by which we can defeat the virus, and avoid a second wave of infections.The outlook on our battle against COVID-19 remains optimistic, for which we thank God and you, the Ghanaian people.

My absence without permission for 55 days from school.2. My failure to prepare and submit lesson notes for vetting by the headmaster3. My failure to respond to queries served on me by the Headmaster and the School Support Officer, as evidence of my gross insubordination.On Sunday 19th December 2021, the said letter was, contrary to my protected privacy interests, and the Code of Conduct of the GES released into the public domain, by persons working for the GES, through their surrogates.I am still considering my legal options against the GES and shall speak to that at a latter time. However, I issue this statement to address the allegations contained in the letter in the interest of the urgent national debate that must happen if we are all truly committed to fixing our broken educational systemAbsence without Permission1. Contrary to the claims by the GES that, I was absent from School for 55 days without permission, I state categorically that this information is false and misleading.2. In fact, during the proceedings, the Committee established that on the relevant occasions, I had at all times received permission from the head of my institution.3. The Committee heard from colleague teachers and established that in fact, the head of my institution put in place a flexible working arrangement that enabled me to teach, while taking Fridays off, to enable me seek sponsorship for the School and the District. All those days was covered by a substitute teacher.4. The Committee also established that the headmaster actually informed the entire teaching Staff that because I had taken on the task of seeking support and sponsorship for the School, and that this was yielding results, had he had decided to make it flexible for me to able to combine my official teaching duties, with my social responsibilities for the school and the district. I was encouraged to do these activities and made to understand that acting as a social ambassador for my school was expected from teachers and a good example to follow.5. The Committee took issue with the fact that the permission I had obtained was oral and not written. However, the GES Code of Conduct, which was drawn to their attention clearly specifies that permission need not be only written, it can also be verbal. In fact, the GES Code of Conduct only insists on a written permission, when a Staff is seeking to travel outside of the Country. (See Rule 3.15)6. I challenge all teachers in this Country, to state that they have never received an oral permission from their headteachers to be absent from school at any time.7. I find that this attempt to reinterpret the Code of Conduct in order to ground the motivated decision to dismiss me, smacks of discrimination and confirms my suspicion that I have been victimized for my criticisms of GES through8. I note that the Management claims that in proposing that I be dismissed from the Service they have into consideration the fact that I have taken several steps which have brought in significant sponsorship support for the School and the entire district. I find it however bizarre, that they will acknowledge the fruits that the special dispensation by the headteacher allowed me to secure for the district, while recommending that I be dismissed. So how was my industry to go above and beyond my duties as a teacher taken into account in order to dismiss me?Failure to Submit Lesson Notes1. Management claims that I refused to prepare and submit lesson notes to the headmaster for vetting.2. This information is also untrue and skewed to justify a baseless decision.3. In fact, the Committee found that I had at all times typed and printed my lesson notes which I presented to the Headmaster. Except that my headmaster continued to insist that the lesson notes must be handwritten and refused to accept printed lesson notes until the past term.4. It is thus not true that the lesson notes were not prepared and submitted.5. In fact, the major disagreement was whether the GES Code of Conduct requires that lesson notes be handwritten and cannot be typed and printed.6. I note that several schools in the District and across Ghana, accept for teachers to type and print their lesson notes; and that there is no uniform practice across the country. It seems both bizarre and disingenuous for Management to fail to demonstrate which part of the GES Code of Conduct insists that lesson notes must be handwritten lesson. Also, I challenge teachers to speak up publicly whether their schools all insist on handwriting lesson notes.7. In any event, what purpose does it serve to bar teachers from typing and printing their lesson notes, while at the same time procuring and surcharging teachers with laptops.8. What is the purpose of the laptops? That they should not be incorporated in teaching?Failure to respond to queries served on me by the Headmaster and the School Support Officer1. I deny the claim that I was insubordinate and reiterate that I did not disobey, disregard or willfully default in carrying out any lawful instruction, reasonable order given by any person, Committee or Board, having authority to do so.2. It is not true that I was grossly insubordinate and had failed to respond to queries served on me.3. In fact, this issue was not part of the charges I was invited to respond to. I am then surprised to see this issue raised as part of the reasons for dismissing me. The Committee did not provide me with any evidence to support this claim.4. As I understand, it offends my rights to fair hearing to be dismissed on charges that I have not been invited with sufficient clarity to respond to.1. I encourage Ghanaians to be less pliable and to avoid swallowing every statement our public institutions make hook-line-and-sinker. Let us make our decisions by being willing to read between the lines and by examining the context of steps taken by Ghanaian institutions. If we do that, we can then be better placed to hold our institutions accountable.2. If we want to protect whistleblowers and support public servants who are willing to be bold in speaking out against injustice, then we must be particularly willing to go beyond official reasons and placid language, that misdirects us to look the other way, when injustice occurs.3. When the system wants to get you; the system will get you. It does not matter if you are in a constitutionally protected office. We know this all too well; yet we make the same mistakes again when we accept official narratives all too willingly.4. In my life as a teacher, I am yet to see a staff who was victimized and dismissed for demanding better for their school and district, and who was given a dismissal letter that stated that “Mr X was dismissed for making GES unpopular.”5. Official letters do not provide confirmation of victimization. If we want our teachers to be bolder in exposing rot, we need to be more analytical and more probing. Wholesale reliance on official narratives is not how we will #FixGES or any broken system.Call our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",Teacher Kwadwo Provides 20 Solid Responses To Rubbish Dismissal,"Frank A.

The embattled presenter also accused the IGP of working in cahoots with criminals and on the payroll of top criminals in Ghana.However, Mr. Annan has evaded service continuously until lawyers for the IGP procured alternative service through newspapers and by pasting copies on the premises of Net2 television. Mr. Annan has refused and neglected to file an appearance in court until lawyers for Mr. Asante-Apeatus applied for judgment in default of appearance and defence which was scheduled for hearing in November. But after filing an appearance through the brother of Kenney Agyapong in October, Mr. Annan has failed to file any defence to date.On Tuesday 7 December 2021, lawyers for Mr. Asante-Apeatu, led by Sammy Darko, attempted to move an application on notice for judgment in default of defence. Although the lawyers had complied with all the rules and a copy of proof of service on lawyers of Mr. Annan were on the docket, Justice Baiden asked them to slow down. He admonished them to be careful with the action and in his own words: “counsel did not know who they are dealing with.”Judge: You seem to be in a hurry to finish this caseLawyer: Yes, my Lord. And today being my birthday, I would have loved to move the motion and get a judgment for my clientJudge: Laughs, you are a young man, how old are you at the bar, you don’t know the people you are dealing withLawyer: My Lord, I am in my 5th year. I know the people I am dealing with. I have other cases against them before your sisters and brothersJudge: Laughs, I don’t know them.

After completion, he ventured into footwear on the streets of Adum and Moro market.In 2010, Mr. Marfo realised his inability to fulfill his dream of enrolling at Adisadel College and decided to write B.E.C.E again but he was not given admission to Adisadel College.According to him, he could not stand the disappointment of not fulfilling his dream of attending his cherished school.“Three years later in 2010, I couldn’t stand the desire of not fulfilling my dream school. I marshaled courage and got myself enrolled in Modern Educational Centre at Auakwa Sepaase in Kumasi to rewrite BECE. Despite having aggregate 6, I was still denied to be enrolled in Adisco”.With the adage “no Santa no school in Ghana” with ‘Santa’ as Adisadel, Mr. Marfo never gave up as he wrote B.E.C.E again in 2011 yet was denied admission after attaining aggregate 6.He was given admission to TI Ahmadiyya with the assurance from the Headmaster of Adisadel College of transferring him after Form 2 but he left after his first year and started a lotto business at Adum.After Mr. Marfo’s year at TI Ahmadiyya, he left without transferring to Adisadel. He said ” for the third attempt I was placed in Ekumfi TI Ahmadiyya to offer science. I went there on a promise of the then Headmaster of Adisadel College that I would be admitted to my dream College on a transfer basis in form 2.Why should I be enrolled as a transfer student to Adisco? These words kept eating me up and made me forget the promise. Due to this, I went to E-AMASS for only the term”At age 26, Mr. Marfo wrote B.E.C.E for the fourth time as a private candidate yet he was given admission not to Adisadel but to his first school Samma Senior High School. He denied admission and continue his business.After five years of waiting and hoping Mr. Marfo wrote his fifth B.E.C.E in 2020 and this time he gained admission to his dream school Adisadel College at age 32.He recounts this event as the happiest day of his life. He says “A year later in 2021, finally! finally! God answered my prayers and gave me my long-awaited childhood dream school Adisadel College to study ICT on the 1st March 2021 at age 32. And that has been the happiest day in my life since I was ever born”.Credit: Story curated from the Facebook timeline of Gyesi Boako Call our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",32-Year Old Man Gains Admission To Adisadel To Fulfil Childhood Dream,"Nana Ama Sarfowaa, Reporter",2022/01

However the industry is facing mounting criticism for not doing enough to deal with problem gambling and addiction.The privately held company is owned jointly by Ms Coates and members of her direct family, including her brother John who is joint chief executive and her father Peter, the firm’s chairman. Last year Ms Coates’ pay and dividends were reported to total £217m. In the year to the end of March her basic pay rose from £199m to £220m. The firm paid out £90m in dividends in the same year, half of which are thought to have gone to Ms Coates, as the owner of half of Bet365’s shares.Ms Coates earned a first class degree in econometrics – the application of statistical methods to economic data – from Sheffield University before joining the High Street betting firm, run by her father. She identified the potential of online gambling in 2000 and invested in the domain name Bet365.com so that she could drive the family business in that direction.Bet365, now the largest private sector employer in Stoke, has millions of customers worldwide. It offers sports betting, poker, casino, games, and bingo. The accounts showed that the firm’s revenues grew by 25% in the year to the end of March and operating profit was up by 31%.While the online gambling sector has ballooned in recent years, it has also come in for increasing criticism over its impact on some customers who have become addicted or accrued large debts. Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson recently described gambling as a “public health emergency”.Bet365 said it was continuing to develop strategies to identify gamblers at risk and to “help customers bet responsibly”. However, Luke Hildyard, spokesman for the High Pay Centre, which campaigns against excessive executive remuneration, said “betting companies are not exactly a force for good in the world”. “There is an increasing perception that big business only serves the interests of an elite few – a billionaire taking hundreds of millions more from a company that profits, in part, from other people’s addictions does nothing to dispel that perception,” he said.Ms Coates, 51, lives in Cheshire with her husband, Richard Smith, who also serves as the firm’s property director, and their children.The group owns Stoke City Football Club, which made a loss of £21m and in 2017 the group paid £75m into its charitable fund, set up in Ms Coates name.

“Political ‘vigilantism’ is spiralling out of control and government doesn’t appear to be able to deal with the situation. And the tragedy is that most of our moral society have become passive spectators.”The comment of Mr Mahama comes in the wake of series of acts of vandalism and lawlessness that have been registered in various parts of the country since the NPP came to power.Available statistics indicates that more than 19 acts of impunity by pro NPP vigilante groups have been recorded since January 2017.Call our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online","“You Reap What You Sow”, Mahama Blames Akufo-Addo For Political Lawlessness",ABOAGYE FRANK,2017/10

The angst, fear and panic exhibited by many, especially when the first two (2) cases were recorded on our shores, have been replaced, in recent weeks, by a growing sense of optimism and renewed hope that we are on our way to winning the battle against the pandemic.The improvement in the situation is all thanks to the effectiveness of the measures put in place by Government, the co-operation and support of you, the Ghanaian people, and, most certainly, by the grace of Almighty God.When I delivered Update No. 16, exactly three weeks ago, the number of recorded active cases, that is persons with the virus, stood at one thousand, eight hundred and forty-seven (1,847). This number, as at Friday, 18th September 2020, has reduced considerably to five hundred and seven (507) persons.There are, currently, some regions in the country without active cases. Greater Accra, Eastern, Ashanti and Central Regions account for some eighty percent (80%) of the active cases.So far, a total of forty-five thousand, two hundred and fifty-eight (45,258) persons have recovered, and two hundred and ninety-seven (297) persons, a great majority of them with underlying illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic liver disease and asthma, have sadly died.In the face of these encouraging statistics, I know there are many who are wondering why I have not announced a complete return to normalcy in all aspects of national life, because they believe the figures suggest we have turned the tide in the fight against the virus.Yes, our death rate continues to be low, and our hospitals have, mercifully, not been overwhelmed, as there are, presently, only twenty (20) severe and critical cases. Indeed, there are a lot of empty beds in our treatment centres, and the isolation centres have virtually no patients under care. But truth be told: we cannot afford, at this critical moment, to throw caution to the wind, and destroy the incredible amount of work undertaken by Government, health officials, heroic frontline health workers, and members of the security agencies, in bringing us this far.Now more than ever, we must be even more disciplined in our adherence to the personal hygiene, mask wearing and social distancing measures that have become part of our daily routines. That is the way to eliminate the virus altogether. The experience in other parts of the world show us that the virus can return with a vengeance, once you let your guard down.Sixteen (16) out of the twenty-three (23) airlines that operated in Kotoka prior to its closure have, again, commenced flights to and from Accra. As at yesterday, Saturday, 19th September, a total of ten thousand and sixty-one (10,061) passengers have been tested at Kotoka.In spite of the requirement that all passengers must be in possession of a negative PCR test result upon their arrival in Ghana, a test which should have been conducted not more than seventy-two (72) hours before the scheduled departure from the country of origin, a total of twenty-six (26) positive cases have been recorded from the tests at KIA.Let us pause for a moment and imagine what would have happened if these twenty-six (26) positives had not been detected, and had been allowed to mingle with the population.Even though the cost of one hundred and fifty United States dollars (US$150) per passenger, for the mandatory airport COVID test, has been criticised in certain quarters, the value of the test in its speed, accuracy and savings for passengers, who no longer have to bear the cost of the 14-day mandatory quarantine in hotels, has been clearly established.It is worth noting that a lot of people, who have experienced at first hand the service being offered at our international airport, have praised the country for the innovation and farsightedness on display at our airport. Let me assure you again that, as President of the Republic, I will do everything in my power to protect you and stop the importation of the virus into our country, or limit and contain its spread. This is my solemn commitment to you.On Friday, 18th September, five hundred and thirty-one thousand, six hundred and seventy-four (531,674) JHS 3 students completed the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE). SHS 3 students also, on 5th September, wrote the last paper of the West Africa Senior Secondary Certificate Examinations (WASSCE).I am particularly excited at this development because, despite the fears and genuine anxiety expressed by some, and the criticisms proffered by some in the political space, these students have gone to school, studied, sat and completed their examinations unscathed. Their forward march in life has not been interrupted. And, by the grace of God, the predictions made by some of widespread infections and even deaths did not materialise.I pledged I will be the last person to put the lives of students at risk, and I express my deep appreciation to all parents and guardians for the trust reposed in me and Government. I pray for the success of the students in their exams.On Monday, 14th September, I extended, by Executive Instrument, the mandatory wearing of face masks by another three (3) months. So, until 14th December 2020, the wearing of masks remains mandatory, and the law enforcement agencies will be required to ensure this directive is respected by all. It has served us well in the fight against COVID-19, so I urge each and every one of us to wear our masks, and do so correctly anytime we leave our homes. It is the new normal requirement of our daily existence until the virus disappears.Towards the progressive easing of restrictions, Government has taken the decision to allow the resumption of training in all contact sports, taking into consideration the imminent participation of our national teams in international competitions. Indeed, some national teams have already been given the dispensation to begin training, ahead of their international engagements. All sports people, who are camped, are to be tested regularly.With respect to football, after due consultations with the Ghana Football Association, it has been decided that the Ghana Premier League and the Division One Football League will restart on Friday, 30th October, with a full regime of testing of the players, technical and management staff.No spectators will be allowed at the training centres, and, when actual competition resumes, seating at all stadia will be limited to twenty-five percent (25%) capacity to ensure social distancing. Wearing of masks by spectators at stadia will be mandatory. The restart of all other sporting competitions will be determined on a case-by-case basis, pending consultations between the Ministry of Youth and Sports and the respective sport associations.Private burials, still, with a maximum of one hundred (100) persons, can continue to be performed. Our borders, by land and sea, will remain closed to human traffic until further notice. Beaches, pubs, cinemas and nightclubs remain closed until further notice. All other institutions that have been cleared to function are to continue to do so in strict adherence to the COVID-19 protocols.Fellow Ghanaians, as we work to rid the virus from our shores, let us continue to remember, at all times, that this virus is no respecter of persons, and has wreaked its havoc on every country on the planet.There are countries that are imposing lockdowns all over again, others are imposing curfews, all in a bid to curb the onset of fresh infections and a second wave. Let us continue to look out for one another, and remain each other’s keeper. United, and with one goal in mind, we will emerge victorious in the fight against COVID-19. Zero active cases must be the ultimate aim.My rallying cry to you all remains: this too shall pass!

Yes! it has been described by gynecologists as totally and completely unique.Despite its uniqueness, little is known about it because of our cultural, religious and  psychological makeup.For example, do you know that there no two akosua kumas in the world that look the same, smell the same, or feel the same.Yeah, relax because you are a special chick with a special vag*na.In this article, you are going to read some basic facts about the vag*na which makes it unique and different from other organs in the human body.1. Women do not pee through their vag*na. Are you surprised? Curious but that is the truth. Most people don’t know this too. There are three openings in your private part; the urethra ( where you pee through), the vag*na and the anus.2. Your vag*na can turn itself inside out. This condition known as the Pelvic Prolapse happens as people get older but can be fixed. Estrogen decline and multiple deliveries are usually the common risk factors.3. Once your virginity is broken it cannot be recovered. There are myths that there are ways of getting your virginity back but Don’t be fooled such myths are not true. Once your virginity is gone, forget it, it is gone for good. There is no way to get it back.4. Your akosua kumal muscles need exercise just like the muscles in other parts of your body, your pelvic muscles ( the ones found in your akosua kuma) need exercise too. If you do not engage in the atopaual act regularly, make sure you make up for it by engaging in some exercise routine.5. Every vulva ( vag*nal lip) is different There is no general design to what the outer layer of your akosua kuma should look like. Every vulva differs form the other. Learn to accept yours the way it is.6. Most women don’t get orgasms from atopa alone If you have been wondering, well this is it. Most women need their clitoris to be directly stimulated during atopa and not the atopaual act itself.7. The vag*na doesn’t need to be douched. The vag*na is a self-cleansing organism and doesn’t need you spraying it or douching with other products just to get it to smell better. Your akosua kuma has its own natural smell and its nothing like your perfume. Except you have an infection, any smell it emits is normal.8. Vag*nal discharge varies from woman to woman How much akosua kumal discharge you make varies widely. Some normal, healthy women spew loads of discharge and need to wear panty liners every day. Others are bone dry. As long as you are not at risk of STD’s and you have no itching, burning, or odor, you’re probably just fine. If in doubt, see your gynecologist.9. Your menstrual blood is supposed to clot Don’t get worried just yet when you see some clotting in your menstrual blood, its usually just your uterine lining. On the other hand, when you see some clotting accompanied by a heavy flow, then something might be up.10. As you get older, your akosua kuma might feel drier during atopa. No matter how young a woman is, it is okay to need lubrication during atopa but this is more rampant among older women.11. Your vag*na farts too Usually called a ‘queef’ or ‘varts’, the akosua kuma can emit sounds just like a fart during atopa or exercise. Don’t be embarrassed its perfectly normal.12. After giving birth akosua kumally, it’s okay to feel loose as giving birth stretches out your akosua kumal muscles so it is perfectly okay if your akosua kuma hangs loose for a while after that.13. Sex should not be painful. If you experience pain during atopa, don’t keep quiet about it. See your doctor.Credit: theredgossipblogCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",13 Basic Facts About The Vag*na Every Woman Should Know,"Frank A.

They raised churches on top of temples.”“The time has come to reconcile but first they should ask forgiveness,” the president says.Mexico has the world’s second biggest Roman Catholic population, after Brazil.Just over a fifth of Mexicans consider themselves to be indigenous but studies suggest many more have some pre-Hispanic ancestry.When Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited Mexico in January he presented President López Obrador with his grandfather José Obrador’s Spanish birth certificate, from 1893, AFP news agency reports.The Mexican leader’s relations with Spain’s centre-left ruling party have been friendly but the government in Madrid promptly rejected his request for an apology.“The arrival, 500 years ago, of Spaniards to present Mexican territory cannot be judged in the light of contemporary considerations,” the government said in a statement.“Our two brother nations have always known how to read our shared past without anger and with a constructive perspective.”There was no immediate comment from the Vatican but three years ago, on a visit to Mexico, Pope Francis asked indigenous people for forgiveness over the way they had been excluded from society.“Some have considered your values, culture and traditions to be inferior.

And ‘Caleb, Dampare saved my father’s life o’ was the first response when I asked ‘how is he?’.‘Why, is the IGP your dad’s friend?’ No, he is not. So how did you meet him and how did he save your dad’s life? The account goes as follows.Her father’s otherwise stable medical situation was fast deteriorating. He had become stiff – couldn’t talk nor walk with a flavour of diarrhea. Panicking, she did the unthinkable.The traffic on the Spintex road was mad! So she drove in the middle of the road – jittery! Any delay, she feared would be denial of her dad’s life. That is if he had any chance at life.But she was stopped in her tracks! Someone in the company of policemen asked her what was wrong. She tried to signal her interrogator that she had an emergency.Relax. She was told. Certainly, she failed to communicate. But she repeated her fruitless attempt at communicating her pressing situation.My friend relax. This time, it was an order. When she managed to calm down and her situation was properly relayed, the man asked the police dispatch ahead of him to rather lead her to the hospital.An angel must have lost his way in heaven to provide her light in her darkest moment on the hottest hour of a really bright day. But there was a challenge.The drivers only gave way to the police dispatch ahead. By the time it gets to her, they blocked her.The police upon noticing her struggle, took over the driving. Luckily they got to the hospital in time. And it took these same police officers to help carry him out of the car. Her father was stabilized. A call came through the police.She was asked if everything was ok. She responded in the affirmative.This man then advised her to call the ambulance next time she has an emergency instead of take things into her own hands. He expressed his best wishes and they said their goodbyes.It was after the call that the officers with her asked, do you know who you spoke to?No. She answered! Well, that was the IGP Dr. George Akufo Dampare! She tells me she was gobsmacked.She had heard in her words, a lot of hype around the IGP that he is working, he is working.But she hadn’t seen anything special bia! Today, she has been overwhelmed by the wave of refreshing professionalism and servant leadership the Ghana Police Service is blowing over the country under Dr. George Akufo Dampare’s watch.She said, you are the one who writes plenty English. Please write for the world to know so they give him all the support he needs. He saved my father’s life.Me: we all can’t wait for every boot shined by our taxes, to carry a heart of compassion like that of Dr. Dampare.We can’t wait for every gun-wielding uniformed man fed by our taxes, to look out for us and watch our backs as displayed in this story instead of the opposite.While we wait for that day, it is not out of place to let the backbenchers know, we are cheering them to the finish line of their pledge to serve with integrity by celebrating the sterling examples of their torchbearers.

To do it, he gathered his friends and those of his brother with the idea of playing matches that simulated a league.Each match was broadcasted on YouTube and the points go towards a fictional league in which only Hashtag exist. One season consists of 10 matches and with 12 points the team are promoted, while they need at least five to avoid relegation.wen was intelligent and kept his idea original, helping the viewers to feel part of the club each week.Their involvement was not limited to matches and during periods without games players were videoed trying to overcome challenges in order to unlock rewards, such as a new signing. Adebayo Akinfenwa posed with the Hashtag shirt before signing for League One side Wycombe.What began as something fun became a social media phenomenon in England and Hashtag United acquired fame, recognition and followers, so much so that Football Manager included them in their database. Big name companies have also stepped forward, with Coca Cola funding a tour of the US while the club left Umbro to sign a contract with Adidas while they are sponsored by Football Manager.Despite it being fun, nothing is left to chance and everything is studied and taken seriously. Each game is filmed by four cameras and edited carefully before being uploaded to YouTube.On the field, they take the same approach, as was witnessed when they won the Wembley Cup in 2017, a tournament that is played out by the biggest youtubers and a number of football legends, which was played out in front of over 50,000 spectators.Their idea is to continue being a team of friends who have fun, but without losing the aim to improve in all aspects.That in mind, they are going to start in a real league rather than a fictional one, but without changing their core principles.Hashtag United started this season in the Southern Counties East Football League with hopes of achieving more.At the moment, nothing is going wrong, they lead their division and are currently favourites for promotion.If they do go up, they would only need eight more consecutive promotions to reach the Premier League.The academy a e-Sports teamAnother success of Owen is that in 2017 he created an academy to attract you talent to the team and, as ever, he did it with originality.Owen created a Masterchef-style contest that was split into eight chapters and used audience involvement.More than 20,000 people applied to be part of the team and the winner was Scott Pollock, a 17-year-old who would soon be signed by a semi-professional club.The formula was a success and they now have an e-sports team with five players – three of whom competed a the eWorld Cup in 2018 – who all moved to London to join the club.This story was first published by Marca via: USAHint SportsCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",The remarkable success of Hashtag United,"Frank A.

Barcelona midfielder Suarez set for Arsenal loan deal ‘in next few hours’
Barcelona midfielder Suarez set for Arsenal loan deal ‘in next few hours’Liverpool spent the bulk of the season hunting City down at the summit before the Manchester club went through their blip in December which saw them lose two league games in a row.James Milner and Daniel Sturridge are the only players in the squad who have been involved in a title race and succeeded at winning a Premier League so it’s not clear how this group of players will deal with City breathing down their neck.Liverpool also have a lot of injury concerns in defence – a position where they were vulnerable until the start of this season.Van Dijk’s trained this week after his illness so it’s not clear if he will playSo having Trent Alexander-Arnold (hamstring), Joe Gomez (fractured leg) definitely out and talisman Virgil van Dijk (illness) at least a slight doubt is not ideal preparation at all.Dejan Lovren should make a return from a hamstring injury to partner Joel Matip at centre-back, should Van Dijk be out, and some might say that having these two international centre-backs will be more than enough to cope.But Matip hasn’t played internationally for Cameroon since 2015 and is sometimes a bit flaky, while Lovren is always capable of doing something bizarre especially without the excellent Van Dijk keeping everyone in check.Liverpool’s absentees don’t stop there though. James Milner can’t fill in at right-back after being sent-off in their last game against Palace and they are still waiting on the fitness of Fabinho and Georginio Wijnaldum so Klopp may have to do all sorts of chopping and changing to the team.Following Milner’s suspension, it’s not totally clear who will play at right-backAnd although Leicester have been in bad form, they’ve actually done well against the bigger teams of late, securing wins against Chelsea and Manchester City in December.That combined with the fact Liverpool are not at full strength will make the visitors fancy their chances.Klopp may go for the approach of outscoring Leicester, a tactic he used in pretty much every game last season Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino were fit.This story was originally published by talkSPORT via: USAHint SportsCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to info@ghanaxtra.com and we'll surely put them online",Liverpool vs Leicester: Why this standard Premier League match is now the biggest test for Jurgen Klopp’s men so far this season,Frank A.

He cited an incident in the 80’s where one student scored 100% in a final Bible Knowledge paper, and got the examination body to setup a committee of senior examiners to re-mark his paper, but ended up giving him more marks since they found no errors in his work.Msgr Kumi added that, students of St. James’ Seminary can do extremely well and therefore the school’s full potential is yet to be seen. “Since life begins at 40, I can assure you that with the new breed and caliber of leadership in our Rector (Rev. Fr.) Ebo, the quality of staff that we have today and the character of students that are here, the best is yet to come”, he opined.Speaking as the guest of honour, the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sunyani, Most Reverend Matthew Kwasi Gyamfi highlighted the influence of strict discipline on the achievements of the school and the benefits that come with the church’s involvement in education.“The Seminary Secondary School has maintained its original code of discipline…, its academic standards and continue to offer subjects like Latin…..It is no wonder that the students of St James’ Seminary Secondary School excel in the academic and other fields. This school and many Catholic High schools do demonstrate beyond any shade of doubt that the involvement and acceptance of the church by the state to play its proper role in education delivery produces not only young people with well educated minds but also disciplined and well-governed citizens for our nation..”, he noted.Most Rev. Gyamfi admonished stakeholders to “thank God for the school’s successes and celebrate the anniversary in a more productive way”.The president of the Old Boys Association, Dr Adu Appiah-Kubi, expressed gratitude to the staff of the school and pledged the support of the alumni to the development of the best school in Ghana.The anniversary logo was unveiled after which a fundraiser was held to raise money towards some infrastructural projects being undertaken in the school.St James’ Seminary was established in 1978 by the late Bishop of the Sunyani Catholic Diocese, Most Reverend James Kwadwo Owusu. The school which initially trained only seminarians scored higher in WAEC’s O’ Level Examinations until it opened up in the early 90s and was absolved by government to accept non-seminarians.It has risen through the years to become the best school in Ghana and even produced best WASSCE students in Ghana and West Africa on several occasions. St James’ Seminary and Secondary School has won several awards in both the sciences and arts including the National Independence Day Debate.The anniversary celebrations would be climaxed in November this year.

Solicitor Fiona Onasanya had denied being behind the wheel when her car was spotted being driven at 41mph in a 30mph zone, in July 2017.The Peterborough MP was thrown out of the Labour Party after being convicted of perverting the course of justice.She has been jailed for three months after a re-trial at the Old Bailey.The court heard evidence Onasanya was texting as well as speeding, during the summer recess.Onasanya is the first sitting MP to be jailed since Terry Fields was sentenced to 60 days for failing to pay his £373 poll tax bill in 1991.Her brother Festus was jailed for 10 months for his involvement, after pleading guilty to the same charge.Onasanya was elected as Labour MP for Peterborough in June 2017, six weeks before committing the offence, in Thorney, Cambridgeshire.She had ousted Conservative Stewart Jackson, who had held the seat for 12 years.As he sentenced her, Mr Justice Stuart-Smith told Onasanya: “You have not simply let yourself down, you have let down those who look to you for inspiration, your party, your profession and Parliament.”Her life as a new MP in 2017 was “extremely hectic and chaotic” and she had just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when police began to pursue her, he noted.After Festus falsely filled out her Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP), she made the “disastrous decision” to keep up the lie from November 2017, he said.The prosecution told the court she went on to collude with her brother to avoid being subject to the speeding ticket.Mitigating, Christine Agnew QC said: “Regardless of the sentence it will have a disastrous effect on every aspect of her life and career, a career she has worked very hard for.“She has already been expelled from the Labour Party. At the moment she continues as an independent MP and the reason for that is it is her only income.“It is highly likely as a result of today’s sentencing hearing that she will lose her seat as an MP.“It’s a very public fall from grace. She will inevitably be struck off as a solicitor.”A spokesman for the Labour Party said Onasanya had “let the voters of Peterborough down”.“When she was found guilty she should have immediately done the decent thing and resigned,” he said.“Today’s sentence gives Fiona one last opportunity to act honourably and resign from parliament.“If Fiona does not resign, Labour will support local residents in their efforts to trigger a by-election through a recall petition.” The Conservatives also called for Onasanya to resign as an MP.“She cannot possibly represent her constituents from prison and should do the decent thing and immediately step down,” a spokesman said.  “If she doesn’t, we will campaign to use a recall petition to ensure that the residents of Peterborough can have their say in a by-election for a new MP.” This story was originally published by BBC via: USAHintCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to info@ghanaxtra.com and we'll surely put them online",Fiona Onasanya: Peterborough MP jailed in speeding case,GhanaXtra,2019/01

It is also trite knowledge that individuals associated with the NDC have a bad track record in handling finances and Abeiku is no exception”.AFFA has called on the Board of Trustees of Ghana’s COVID-19 National Trust Fund to withdraw the Ambassadorial appointment of Abeiku Santana as soon as possible.Also, social media is also on fire with some known NPP fanatics condemning the appointment.Read some of the comments belowThose claiming Abeiku Santana is a Ghanaian and not about politics, the same way Dumelevo is also a Ghanaian, why then did you kick him out?Posted by Gabby Morton on Saturday, March 27, 2021My piipo … FYIPosted by Kojo Amoako Twum-Barima on Saturday, March 27, 2021Ghana may not be for only NPP members but would NDC ever appoint an NPP-blooded person as an ambassador for even ludo?

The Japanese automaker announced that Ghosn would be dismissed because of “significant acts of misconduct” that allegedly included underreporting his own salary and using company assets for his personal benefit.Ghosn, a Brazilian-born French citizen of Lebanese descent, also serves as chairman of Mitsubishi Motors and chairman and chief executive of France’s Renault. The French government controls a 15 percent stake in that company, and the news from Japan seemed to catch Paris off guard.“Carlos Ghosn is no longer in a state to lead the group,” said Le Maire, speaking Tuesday morning on France Info television .But Le Maire added that he was calling for answers, not necessarily for Ghosn’s resignation. He said the government began examining Ghosn’s fiscal activities in France once the Nissan news broke in Japan, but that for now, “there is nothing special to report on the tax situation of Mr. Ghosn in France.”For the moment, Le Maire said, the French government would not be demanding Ghosn’s departure from Renault’s board because “we have no proof” of any financial wrongdoing in France.The board is slated to convene Tuesday evening in Paris to settle on a new interim governing structure.The news of Ghosn’s shock arrest sparked an even more defensive reaction in Lebanon, where his heritage is a source of some pride.Lebanese Foreign Minister Gibran Bassil said in a statement he has instructed the Lebanese ambassador in Tokyo to follow the case and ensure that Ghosn gets fair treatment, according to the Associated Press. Ghosn represents “a model of Lebanese success abroad, and the Lebanese Foreign Ministry will stand by him in his crisis to make sure he gets a fair trial,” Bassil said.In Japan, Ghosn’s sudden fall from grace dominated headlines, with details of the accusations against him leaking into the media.National broadcaster NHK said Nissan had paid “huge sums” to buy and maintain luxury residences for Ghosn in Beirut, Paris, Amsterdam and Rio de Janeiro that were not justified for legitimate business reasons.The purchases were not declared in stock market filings, while Ghosn was underpaying or not paying rent, NHK alleged, citing unidentified sources.The Nikkei newspaper, again citing anonymous sources, alleged that nearly $18 million had been funneled through a Dutch subsidiary of Nissan to purchase a condominium on Rio’s prestigious Copa Cabana strip and a luxury home in Beirut.NHK also alleged that Ghosn, who was in charge of paying Nissan’s top 13 executives, had secretly siphoned off some of that money for himself.    Public prosecutors have only confirmed that Ghosn, along with representative director Greg Kelly, was arrested for failing to declare around $44 million in Ghosn’s income on Nissan’s official securities reports submitted over five years starting from 2011. Nissan shares fell more than 5 percent in Tokyo trading Tuesday.“It’s extremely regrettable,” Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters. “We will watch developments closely.”Denyer reported from Yokohama, Japan. Read more:Nissan says chairman Carlos Ghosn has been arrested over alleged financial misconductNissan sees profit dip as sales fall, offsetting cost cutsTesla isn’t the only company creating cool electric vehicles anymoreToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the worldLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign newsCredit:Washington Post via: USAHintCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp.You could equally email your stories or articles to admin@ghanaxtra.com and we'll surely put them online","In wake of Nissan scandal, France calls for ‘interim governance’ at Renault",GhanaXtra,2018/11

The security service had cause to monitor Abedi’s return to the UK from Libya days before the attack in which 22 people died, the report said.Martin Hibbert, injured in the blast, said the truth was now coming out.And Dan Hett, from Survivors Against Terror – who lost his brother Martyn in the attack – said the “litany of mistakes in 2017 must urgently be learnt from”.In wide-ranging criticisms, the committee said the government had also failed to fully learn lessons from attacks dating back 13 years. Abedi is believed to have been taught bomb-making while in Libya, before returning to Manchester in May last year to construct his device. He walked into the foyer of Manchester Arena, where thousands had been watching US singer Ariana Grande perform, and blew himself up. A previous report into the attack revealed that MI5 had planned to review the risks posed by Abedi – but the meeting was not scheduled to take place before the attack occurred. In its findings, the ISC said there had been “no follow-up action” after Abedi visited a jailed terrorist organiser from Manchester. Furthermore, MI5 could have put a plan in place to monitor Abedi’s movements, which would have revealed his return to the UK from Libya, days before he struck. “MI5 have since admitted that given the information they had on Abedi, they should have done so,” said the committee. “Abedi had been flagged for review but MI5’s systems moved too slowly.”The committee said one failing it had identified was so sensitive, it could not be shared publicly. But it added: “What we can say is that there were a number of a failings in the handling of Salman Abedi’s case.“While it is impossible to say whether these would have prevented the devastating attack on 22 May, we have concluded that as a result of the failings, potential opportunities to prevent it were missed.”Mr Hibbert, who was left paralysed by the explosion, welcomed the report’s release. His daughter was also wounded as they left the arena when the bomb went off.“It doesn’t make things any easier but it means at last there is some compassion being shown and some accountability in terms of people saying ‘We didn’t do our job’.“It’s a start. It’s just sad that it’s taken 18 months,” he said.Another survivor, Robby Potter, who took his 11-year-old daughter Tegan to the concert, said he was considering taking legal action against MI5.His injuries from 37 pieces of flying shrapnel have meant he’s been unable to return to his job as a drainage engineer, and now drives lorries.“I’d have more respect for them if they had said immediately after [the attack] ‘we made a mistake – we underestimated this man’,” he said.“I love my country but I was let down. This could have been stopped, and we’re finding out now that it should have been stopped.” In their highly-critical report, MPs and peers on the committee also found: The committee also attacked the Home Office for failing to properly co-operate over its attempts to investigate how the Parsons Green attacker, Ahmed Hassan, went undetected. It had made “multiple attempts” to extract the “full evidence” from the Home Office – but the information had not been provided in time. “This is unacceptable,” said the committee. “From what we have seen to date there were fundamental failings in the handling of this case by the Home Office, the police and Surrey County Council. “This litany of errors will require a separate comprehensive review to which the Home Office must be directly answerable.”Salman Abedi was a “closed subject of interest” for MI5 – someone who had once been a cause of concern – but there had been an assessment on the available intelligence that he was not going to turn to violence. That meant the 22-year-old went into a pool of 20,000 closed SOIs – people who are not under active investigation anymore. What the review makes clear is that the system for triggering a rethink of individuals in that closed group was too slow to react to a changing picture – and the security service has acknowledged its processes didn’t, on this occasion, deliver.The big problem is that intelligence on suspects is fragmentary. A British-Libyan young man travelling to Libya is not the stuff of red alerts. But his visit to a jailed recruiter and facilitator would have been a relevant piece of information for the review of Abedi that had been planned. That information hadn’t reached MI5 before the attack. And that’s why the committee says there are really serious questions to be answered by all arms of government over whether everyone is learning lessons from every terrorism conspiracy of recent years.The committee said that despite these concerns about government, it recognised that MI5 and the police had taken the mistakes seriously. “We note that both MI5 and counter-terrorism policing have been thorough in their desire to learn from past mistakes,” it said.“We also know and acknowledge the determination with which they approach their work, which we regard as impressive. “However, it has been striking how many of the issues which arose in relation to the 2017 terrorist attacks have been previously raised by this committee in our reports on the 7/7 attacks [in 2005] and on the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby [in 2013]. “We have previously made recommendations in all these areas yet the government failed to act on them. The lessons of last year’s tragic events must now result in real action.”Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: “We have updated our counter-terrorism strategy, introduced new legislation to allow threats to be disrupted earlier and have increased information-sharing with local authorities.“We are also ensuring technology companies play their part by stopping terrorists from exploiting their platforms,” he added. Scotland Yard said the police and MI5 have foiled 13 plots since the Westminster attack in March 2017.Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head of counter-terrorism policing, said: “We will not let the terrorists who carried out these appalling attacks to succeed in scaring and dividing us.”The Met was, he said, doing more now to improve the handling and assessment of intelligence and making better use of data.It is currently handling more than 700 live investigations, involving 3,000 people posing the biggest threat and another 20,000 who are also considered a concern. 22 March: Khalid Masood runs down and kills four people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a policeman to death outside Parliament.22 May: Salman Abedi, 22, detonates a home-made bomb in Manchester Arena’s foyer blowing crowds off their feet as they leave an Ariana Grande concert. Twenty-two people die and more than 800 are injured.3 June: Eight people are killed when three attackers drive a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and launch a knife attack in Borough Market.19 June: Darren Osborne drives a van into worshippers near Finsbury Park Mosque, killing one man and injuring nine others.15 September: Ahmed Hassan, 18, plants a home-made bomb on a Tube train at Parsons Green, which injures 51 people when it partially explodes.Credit:BBC via: USAHintCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp.You could equally email your stories or articles to admin@ghanaxtra.com and we'll surely put them online",MI5 ‘too slow’ over Manchester Arena bomber,GhanaXtra,2018/11

http://web.archive.org/web/20181122183640/http://ghanaxtra.com/2018/04/brong-ahafo-region-npp-regional-executive-elections-wins-position.html,http://ghanaxtra.com/2018/04/brong-ahafo-region-npp-regional-executive-elections-wins-position.html,https://ghanaxtra.com/2018/04/brong-ahafo-region-npp-regional-executive-elections-wins-position.html,"The New Patriotic Party (NPP) is scheduled to hold its Annual Regional Delegates Conference nationwide between April 21, 2018 and April 24, 2018.The delegates conference among other things will elect Regional Executives to manage the affairs of the party in the various regions for the next the four years.Here in the Brong Ahafo Region, the Annual Regional Delegates Conference is scheduled to take place at the Pastoral Center, Sunyani on Sunday, 22nd April, 2018.It is on this note that we of the INTEGRITY NETWORK seek to bring to the attention of the general public our initial Observations, analysis, recommendations, and predictions through our research conducted in the month of March 2018.There are Sixteen (16) executive positions which form the Regional Executives Committee. Six (6) out of the sixteen (16) are appointed while the remaining ten(10) are to be contested for during the regional delegates conference in every four years.However, there will be nine (9) positions to be contested for here in Brong Ahafo Region on the 22nd April 2018, at the Pastoral Center.This is because the incumbent Regional Organizer, Mr. Konlaabig Rasheed who doubles as the Brong Ahafo Regional Director of the National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO) is going unopposed.1. CHAIRMANThe race for the chairmanship position is keenly contested between the incumbent Regional Chairman, Thomas Adu Appiah (affectionately called Chairman Thoma) and the immediate past chairman of the Asutifi North constituency, Francis Opoku Sarfo (popularly called Chairman Jerry).The third aspirant for the chairmanship positon, Dr. Charles Addo, is hardly mentioned in any of the conversations. In fact, as at 31st March, 2018 when this research was concluded, Dr. Charles Addo was known only in the two Techiman constituencies where he comes from.Chairman Jerry seems to have a very strong presence in all the constituencies. The delegates feel he is very rich and bring some cohesion to the party front in the region. In some cases, especially among the new executives, he is likened to Chairman Wontumi, who is the Regional Chairman for Ashanti Region. But most of the delegates feel his financial strength is as a result of his connection with the Regional Minister. Others feel he is full of pride. But in a whole he is very affable.Chairman Thoma, on the other hand, who according to our research in the month of March, leads in the Chairmanship race, is very popular among the old executives. They speak very well of him as 1st Vice Chairman and his financial contributions and support for most of the constituencies in the 2016 General Elections. Most of the delegates feel he is genuine, loyal and committed to the course of the Elephant Movement.2. 1ST VICE CHAIRMANThe 1st Vice Chairmanship competition was tipped to be the most competitive of all. However, the euphoria and aura around Kwame Baffoe (a.k.a. Abronye DC) has taken the shine from the much anticipated competitive nature of the 1st vice chairmanship race.Abronye DC is seen by many of his detractors as not couched for the position of the 1st Vice Chairman and many feel he would have done a better job if he had gone for the Regional Organizer.Abronye is seen as a national asset from the Brong Ahafo region with a very strong presence and voice across the length and breadth of the nation. He is also seen to be the voice of the ordinary people, an anti-corruption agent and he is among the few candidates that delegates feel very certain that they will vote for. However, it is important to put on record that party supporters affiliated to the Regional Ministers are against his candidature.His closest rival in the race for the 1st Vice Chairmanship position comes from Dr. Emmanuel Opoku Marfo of Tano North constituency. Dr. Opoku Marfo  has a strong presence across all the constituencies and the delegates speak very well of him and he is seen by many delegates as having a very good message.The observation is that Dr. Opoku Marfo is likely to win more votes from delegates who feel that Abronye is too young for the position of the 1st Vice Chairman.The rest are Mr. Patrick Peprah Appiagyei of Tano North Constituency who comes with the nobility of loyalty, Mr. Dabie Appiah Mensah of Sunyani West Constituency and former Regional Organizer, and Alhaji Shaibu Bamba of the Tain Constituency.3. 2ND VICE CHAIRMANThe race for the 2nd Vice Chairmanship is between the incumbent Mr. Joseph Mensah and Madam Justina Owusu-Banahene. Mr. Joseph Mensah is from the Tain Constituency and is currently the Regional Director of the National Health Insurance Authority. Madam Justina Owusu-Banahene on the other hand is from the Sunyani East Constituency and comes to the race as a former Regional Women Organizer.Most delegates feel Mr. Joseph Mensah is not having a firm control over the management of the NHIA in the region and needs to concentrate his attention in managing that sector. Madam Justina is playing the gender card to her advantage. Delegates want to try her. The research shows that Madam Justina Owusu-Banahene is likely to win more votes ahead of the incumbent, Mr. Joseph Mensah.4. SECRETARYIn the race for the chief scribe’s job are Kofi Ofosu Boateng of Sunyani West Constituency who is the Deputy Secretary cum acting Secretary, David Boakye of Techiman South Constituency who is the immediate past Constituency Secretary, and John Nketsiah of Sunyani East Constituency who worked as a researcher for the party.Our research shows that Kofi Ofosu Boateng has no and little competition from John Nketsiah and David Boakye respectively. Almost all the delegates we talked to spoke of Kofi Ofosu Boateng’s sacrifices, commitment, loyalty and his willingness in the service to the NPP in the Brong Ahafo Region.Kofi is said to have sacrificed his job as the Programme Director and Host of the Super Morning Show at Sky FM to become the first Communications Director for the NPP in the region. They feel he is very humble and almost always at the party secretariat to render service to party faithfuls.John Nketsiah is known as Bugri John for his role as a serial caller on radio. He is said to have adopted the name Bugri to create the impression as northerner. Delegates feel that he was not transparent with some funds placed at his disposal and in some cases threatened to deal with him. However, he is seen to be in the good books of the regional Minister.David Boakye comes to the party as a fantastic gentlemen. David is known mostly in the northern half of the region where he hails from. Delegates feel he is humble and speaks well. But some delegates think that he would have been a better candidate for the Assistant Secretary position.5. ASSISTANT SECRETARYThere are three gentlemen vying for the position of Assistant Secretary. They are Mohammed Baba Gausu of Tano North Constituency, Asare Baffour  and Clement Bonsu both from the Sunyani East Constituency. Surprisingly, at the time of our research, all of them had no or little presence in the various constituencies. It is therefore expected to be a close contest based on the subtle nature of their campaigns.6. TREASURERThe treasurer position is being contested by the incumbent Alhaji Issaka Issa of Sunyani East and Justice Appiah-Antwi of Tano North Constituency who is the Regional Director of MASLOC. Interestingly, our research indicates that this is a one horse race for Alhaji Issaka.Though delegates recognize the fact that Alhaji has some financial administration and educational challenges, they feel he deserves another chance as the treasurer of a party in government.They say that if he had served the party very well in opposition why can’t he serve as a treasurer of the same party in government. As for Justice, the delegates feel he has the competence to do the job but they will still vote for Alhaji for continuity sake.7. YOUTH ORGANIZERThe Youth Organizer position is the most sort after positin with six energetic candidates. Probably inspired by the exploits and the success story of the vociferous Abronye DC. The aspirants are Micheal Osei Boateng of Tano North Constituency who is the substantive Deputy Youth Organizer and the Regional Director for YEA, Abdul Razaak of Dormaa Central Constituency who is the immediate past Constituency Youth Organizer, Eugene Kusi Boakye of Asutifi South Constituency, Benkae Kwame Isaac of Sunyani East Constituency, Kwain Bonse Isaac of Techiman South, and Richard Kwadwo Adu of the Wenchi Constituency.Micheal Osei Boateng leads the race with a very strong presence in all the constituencies. Most delegates feel he has a very good human relation, an enterprising individual and outstanding among the aspirants. Delegates feel he has paid his dues for the party at the regional level and has developed the capacity to rally the youth towards 2020 elections.The biggest challenge for Micheal Osei Boateng comes from Abdul Razak who seems to court the support of the Muslim groups in the region. Razak’s affiliation to Ali Mega who is the MP for Dormaa and former Regional Organizer seems to have some pull effect for his bidding. He also rides on a very strong financial background and seemingly linked with the Regional Minister.Eugene Kusi Boakye is fairly represented in most of the constituencies. He is described as the young man with a powerful message. Delegates feel he speaks well and has great vision. But most delegates think he has a very slim chance of winning. The rest are hardly heard of, with the exception of Kwain Bonse Isaac whose presence is felt in the northern half of Brong.8. WOMEN ORGANIZERWhen it comes to the Regional Women Organizer position, there are three women competing for the honours. They include the incumbent, Dorothy Ama Amponsah, the immediate past Women Organizer for Berekum West, Doris Asomah who is in Charge of the School Feeding Programme, and Patience Tettey( Sorfo Maame).The research conducted in the month of March indicated that Ama Amponsah is likely to win based on her relationship with the old executives who were retained. Most of the delegates who support her feel she has the party at heart and receives them well anytime she hosts them.However, she faces some form of competition from Patience Tettey, who is associated with the Regional Minister and has the Support of the incumbent Deputy Women Organizer. She  preaches unity among the women front and has a strong leanings with Chairman Jerry.The biggest competition for the Women Organizer position comes from Doris Asomah. Doris has most of her support from the newly elected executives. The biggest chunk of the delegates from all the constituencies think she has the best message compared to the competitors. Doris has very good remarks from the various Women Organizers who think she is hard working, respectful and full of humility.Most of the constituencies feel she brings some level of cohesion to the women front in the region and think she is the best person for the position going into the 2020 Election. However, most of them also feel Ama Amponsah deserves another chance.9. NASARA COORDINATORThe position for the Regional Nasara Coordinator is a special creation for the Muslim(Zongo) communities and groupings in the NPP. The position is ably contested by Kassim Siaka of Tain Constituency, Amadu Bermah Suleman and Alhaji Adamu Mohammed, both from the Techiman North Constituency.Most of the delegates we talked to said they were yet to meet with the aspirants. However, most of them said their choice of candidate will be based on the recommendations of their constituency Nasara Coordinators.This report is based on an independent research conducted by Integrity Network & Upgrade Support Services based in Sunyani.Contact:

The Bodi people are neighbours to the Mursi Tribe.The Bodi people are agriculturalists who still engage in trade by barter system.These pastoral people revere their cows. Their cows are so special to them that its blood together with fresh milk is a source of food for this people.Rather than kill the cows, they make a hole in one of its veins to get the blood out and close it back with clay.These animals are also used in certain ceremonies. Among the ceremonies is the peculiar new year celebration.At the start of each year [the month of June in the Gregorian calendar], they hold a “Ka’el ceremony” (ceremony of fat men) to mark the new year celebrations. The Ka’el ceremony is a competition for men who are not married which involves drinking the blood mixture.The 14 clans present a man who is single and they deem fit for the competition. Those who are contesting prepare for six months. During this period, he must not have atopa and must not be seen outside his hut.It is not unusual to see some of these contestants vomit the mixture because two litres was more than they can drink.On the day of the competition, they cover themselves with clay and ashes and display their acrobatic skills.As part of the competition, they run around sacred trees for hours sometimes with the assistance of women.While at it, they are under the watchful eyes of their judges. After this, the people use a sacred stone on a cow before killing it. The intestines are then used to predict what the year holds. When a winner is chosen by the elderly judges, they crown him, “fat man of the year title.”Just like other beauty pageants, there is a prize only this time, it is the lifelong admiration of the Bodi people.Credit: guardianCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",The Bodi Tribe Where Men Drink Blood And Milk,"Frank A.

Using IT to rub the unemployed is cruel. Applicants who will not be recruited have “donated” GHc55.00 to GES.Soon Teachers promotion interview results will be released, you will be charged GH5.00 or more to access the portal to know whether you have passed or failed.It looks like the Ghana Education Service will want to use every opportunity whether legitimate or illegitimate to milk teachers and poor unemployed who could barely make life meet and are struggling to survive.The time has come for people to tell them that enough is enough.

Akuapem Poloo which sought to challenge the 90-day jail term handed to her by the Accra Circuit Court on April 16 this year.This means that Akuapem Poloo will continue serving the jail term handed her by the Circuit court.In a ruling today, the Criminal Division of the court presided over by Justice Ruby Aryeetey upheld the Circuit court decision on grounds that the Circuit court’s decision was not manifestly excessive.“This court will not interfere and the appeal is therefore dismissed,” Justice Aryee said.The court ordered that in the absence of the convict, Akuapem Poloo’s child should be given to any competent person in the family to take care of.Call our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",Akuapem Poloo Back To Prison After Court Quashes Appeal,"Frank A.

Inspector General of Police (IGP).COP Dampare takes over James Oppong-Boanuh who has been IGP since August 14, 2019, as the youngest person to have occupied that seat.He will officially take over on August 1, 2021.He is 50 years old and married with six children.The announcement is set to be officially by President Akufo-Addo in the coming hours.Check his profile below Dr. Dampare joined the Ghana Police Service (GPS) as a Constable in December 1990 at age 20 and rose through the ranks to become Commissioner of Police (COP) 24 years later at age 44 in 2014.In 1991, on completion of his recruit training, Dr. Dampare was adjudged the overall Best Recruit at the National Police Training School and won all awards except the award for the ‘Best Marksman’. Again in 1996, he emerged the overall Best Cadet for the 32nd Cadet Officers’ Course at the Ghana Police Academy (formerly, Police College) and won all awards, including Excellence in Professional Police Subjects and Excellence in Academic Subjects.During his over thirty-year career as a police officer, Dr. Dampare has made significant contributions to policing in Ghana and beyond as enumerated below:At the leadership and management level, Dampare has had the rare privilege of serving as the Head (Director-General) of almost every major department, giving him greater insight into the administration of policing in Ghana. Specifically, Dr. Dampare has been Director-General for Administration and Director-General for Welfare twice.He has also served as Director-General for MTTD, Director-General for Research & Planning, Director-General for Operations, Director-General for ICT, Director-General for Finance, and Director-General for National Patrol Department (Police Visibility Department).Other leadership positions Dr. Dampare previously held include Commandant of the Police Command and Staff College, Accra Regional Police Commander, Regional Commander for Railways, Ports and Harbour (now Police Marine Department), Municipal Commander for Cape-Coast and Chief Internal Auditor of the GPS.Between 2010 and 2015, under the leadership of two IGPs, Messrs. Paul Tawiah Quaye and Mohammed Ahmed Alhassan, Dampare led and coordinated the ‘National Anti-armed Robbery Reward to Informant Initiative’, which saw the arrest and prosecution of many notorious armed robbers across the country.As the Director-General for National Operations, Dr. Dampare created an efficient system where fragmented units were consolidated to create effective and complete departments such as the establishment of an Anti-armed Robbery Unit (the COMBAT Unit) to aggressively fight robbery and other violent crimes. He also created the Intelligence Unit within the National Operations Department, which later informed the creation of a Police Intelligence Department at the national level.As Accra Regional Police Commander, Dampare introduced an innovative and proactive policing strategy called the “Continuous Stakeholder Engagement Programme” where all stakeholders were included and involved in policing the Region. For the first time, through this initiative, the Ghana Police Service under his leadership, visited Political Parties in their offices to engage them.As Director-General in charge of Welfare, Dr. Dampare introduced an innovative social welfare scheme where he led officers from the Department to visit the homes of scores of sick and bedridden police officers across the country, and also introduced strategic medical interventions to facilitate their wellness.In 2013, under the leadership of the then Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mr. Mohammed Ahmed Alhassan, Dr. Dampare led a team of officers, working day and night, to restructure the Armoured Car Squadron (ACS) Unit into the Formed Police Unit (FPU) within a record time of ten (10) weeks. This task had remained impossible for over fifteen years. The FPU has now become one of the police units undertaking internal police operations and international peacekeeping missions under the United Nations and African Union.As the Director-General of the National Patrol Department (Police Visibility Department) and under the leadership of the then IGP, Mohammed Ahmed Alhassan, Dampare supervised the implementation of the novel “Police Visibility” programme which saw the presence of police personnel at most intersections and communities in Ghana.Again, during the implementation of the vision of the then IGP, Mohammed Ahmed Alhassan, for the creation of the Police Service Command and Staff College at Winneba and the Police Service Public Safety Training School at Pwalugu, Dr. Dampare was the leader of the technical teams that ensured the full operationalization of these two specialist training institutions.Dampare is credited with the idea that led to the establishment of the office of the Armourer-General which serves as the central point for accounting for arms and ammunitions within the Ghana Police Service as well as the establishment of the Service Enquiry Monitoring Unit (SEMU) with the responsibility of managing the GPS disciplinary system.As Coordinator of the National Inter-Ministerial Task Force for the 2007 Ghana Floods which was under the overall leadership of Dr. Mrs. Mary Chinnery-Hesse (then Chief Advisor to H.E. President J.A. Kufuor), Dr. Dampare led a team, within a seven-month period, to develop and implement a National Disaster Management Model, which brought all United Nations Agencies, Red Cross and Civil Society organizations, among others, together, to successfully manage the disaster.As Director-General for Finance, Dampare led a Police Technical Implementation Team to work with the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission, to migrate the Police Service onto the Single Spine Salary Structure as the first institution in the country to successfully complete the migration.Still as Director-General for Finance, Dampare also introduced the payment of recruits’ allowances through the bank by getting them bank accounts as well as ATM cards. He also engaged the banks and got them to build ATMs at the Police Training Schools at no cost to the Government.Under the visionary instructions of the then IGP, Mr. Paul Tawiah Quaye, Dampare also led a team to establish the Procurement Unit of the GPS and ensure full implementation of the Procurement Act. He introduced cost-saving measures in the repair of Service vehicles and the use of hotel accommodation, among others.Dampare led a team of officers to use mostly donations from the private sector to give a facelift to the Police Headquarters by constructing a Public Affairs building, the Integrity Square, the Police Fitness and Social Centre and a Helipad. The CID Headquarters building was also refurbished under his leadership.As Accra Regional Commander, Dampare raised sufficient capital from the private sector to complete a new office complex and re-roofed 90% of all office buildings at the Regional Headquarters which had been in a deplorable state for years.During his policing career, Dr. Dampare has undertaken numerous law enforcement courses at tactical, operational, strategic leadership and management levels, making him an all-round police officer with the required skills and competences commensurate with his rank.Aside his policing, Dr. Dampare previously worked as a Research Fellow and lecturer at King’s College London, University of London. He also lectured at the University of Cape-Coast (UCC), Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA), Regent University College and the Data Link University College. He is also one of the pioneer lecturers at the Business School of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi.Having passed the GCE Ordinary and Advanced level examinations as a private candidate in 1989 and 1992 respectively, Dr. Dampare proceeded to study accountancy and became a Chartered Accountant in 1996 at age 25. He also holds a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D) degree in Finance and Management from the King’s College, London, University of London, and has two Master of Science degrees with distinction in Accounting & Finance, from London South Bank University, UK and Business Systems Analysis & Design from City University of London, UK.Dr. Dampare also has a certificate in High Impact leadership from the Institute for Sustainability Leadership, University of Cambridge, UK and a certificate in Leadership and Management from the Aresty Institute of Executive Education, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, USA.Dr. Dampare is a member of a number professional associations including the International Association of Chiefs of Police (ICP), International Association of Crime Analysts (IACA), the Institute of Chartered Accountants (ICA) and the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA).Dr. Dampare has also served and continues to serve on several boards including the Economic and Organized Crime Office (EOCO) Governing Board, Data Link University College Council, Police Central Disciplinary Board and the Pumpkins Foundation Board (a philanthropic organization for underprivileged children, including those with autism).Call our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",COP Dampare Replaces Oppong-Boanuh As IGP,Staff Writer,2021/07

Manasseh Instructs Lawyers Over Continuing Defamation by Kennedy Agyepong
***********************My attention has been drawn to a sustained smear campaign of outright lies by Assin Central MP, Kennedy Agyepong, against my person. This started when I published the “Contracts for Sale” documentary that implicated and resulted in the removal from office of the CEO of the Public Procurement Authority, Adjenim Boateng Adjei.It is within his right to stand by Mr. A.B Adjei, who defended Kennedy Agyepong’s wife’s contract with the Ministry of Energy worth over 100 million cedis when questions were raised about the propriety of the contract.However, it is unacceptable to continue to lie blatantly when he knows that there’s no truth in his malicious and defamatory claims that I sought a bribe in the investigative report.My lawyers advised that ignore him when he started the false publications. But it is obvious he has not and will not stop unless compelled by a court.I have therefore instructed my lawyers to sue him and the platforms he uses to publish the falsehood.Signed.

And also the fact that Council was establishing a disciplinary committee to deal with the recommendations of the fact-finding committee.“In the above instance, my response was to draw the Council Chairnan’s attention to the inappropriateness of his actions and the fact that those decisions were contrary to the Statutes of UEW, which we have all sworn to protect. The Chairman disregarded my protestations and went ahead to call for the meeting to come to an end. I immediately left for the house, since I needed to ensure that my kids were safe and sound.”Background There has been a serious rife between the University of Education, Winneba and some lecturers ever since Supi Kofi Kwayera filed a writ at the Winneba High Court in May 2017,  challenging the continuous stay in office of the university’s council.Supi Kofi Kwayera avers that the mandate of the council had expired in November 2013.
The Vice-Chancellor, Professor Mawutor Avoke and the Finance Officer, Dr Theophilus Senyo Ackorlie were then ordered by the Winneba High Court in July 2017 to hand over to the Pro-Vice-Chancellor until the final determination of the case.The duo together with three other officials were later interdicted by the University’s council to avoid tampering with evidence following allegations of financial malfeasance leveled against them.Following the development, the UTAG branch of UEW went to the Supreme Court praying that it overturns the High Court order to the Vice-Chancellor and Finance Officer.The lecturers argued that the High Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case filed by Supi Kwayera.UTAG also claimed the plaintiff at the High Court also had no interest in the matters of the university.They alleged that the move was a witch-hunting tactics to keep out of office, the Vice-Chancellor and others out of office.On 20th December 2017, the Supreme Court, upon an application by the University Teachers Association of Ghana, Winneba Chapter, (UTAG – UEW) quashed the decision of the High Court, Winneba to assume jurisdiction over the matter brought before it by Supi Kofi Kwayera and set aside the application of Supi Kofi Kwayera invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court. Interestingly, the university’s Council, at its meeting on 28th December 2017, disregarded the Supreme Court’s order and went ahead to reappoint the Pro Vice-Chancellor, Reverend Professor Anthony Afful Boni as the acting Vice-Chancellor.

In the first instance, a 3-year-old child was defiled by a teacher in Assin Ayitey.Another rape case was also reported in Assin Awireso as a 15-year-old girl was defiled by her stepfather in the bush as they were going to tap palm wine.The latest case in the Municipality which has raised a lot public outcry involves of a 4-year-old girl who has been defiled by a community member at Assin Adadientem.According to Monica Nyarko, the mother of the little girl, her 4-year old daughter was defiled by one Kwabena during her absence.The child who could barely work due to pain is currently receiving treatment at the St Francis-Xavier Hospital in Assin Fosu but it is feared she could not walk again.Monica tells Ghanaxtra.com that even though the suspect has been identified, the traditional rulers in the village are trying to shield the suspect.She allege that the opinion leaders say the suspect is innocent since the gods in the community have given a not guilty verdict.Looking at the rate at which the cases are becoming rampant, it is imperative for the appropriate bodies to start a crack down on such miscreants.Call our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",Assin Fosu Municipality: A Den Of Rape Cases Where Rapists Are Protected By The gods,ABOAGYE FRANK,2017/10

And I will come as a man and answer you on Airbus. If you think I’m indicted in Airbus, accuse me directly.“But because he is a coward and he knew they were going to discuss Agyapa, he put a paragraph on Airbus to equalise the discussion. I mean what stupidity is this?” he said.A press release issued by the Office Of Special Prosecutor however defends the inclusion of the Airbus issue in the Agyapa report. The SP in the release insists the NDC Candidate is Government Official 1.He further accuses the former President of guaranteeing the passport application of his brother Samuel Adam Mahama despite knowing very well he had not attended the University of Ghana as claimed.See full release below:Call our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online","Airbus Scandal: Show Up So I interrogate You, Amidu Challenges Brave Mahama","Frank A.

He’ll leave camp today (Tuesday).“Chris is a fantastic player who knows his way to the try-line. He’s been great around the squad the last few weeks. It’s very disappointing he’s out.”Ashton fell out of favour under Stuart Lancaster and then Jones, whose opportunities to pick the dual code international were restricted by a succession of bans.Ashton scored a try in England’s slim 16-15 defeat to New ZealandHe made only one appearance for Sale this season due to a seven-week suspension incurred for a tip-tackle before being picked by England.Jonny May and Jack Nowell are set to be restored to the wings for the first time since the series opener against South Africa, but Bath powerhouse Joe Cokanasiga is a fringe contender to start.Cokanasiga produced a promising debut against Japan, using his 6’4” and 18 stones frame to good effect to score the decisive try and make a number of dents on the Brave Blossoms line.However, having just turned 21-years-old the Wallabies might be deemed too big a hurdle to face.“Joe did really well. He’s got massive potential and is really eager to learn and hungry to learn,” Borthwick said.“Physically he’s got some great attributes and attitude wise he wants to be the best he can be. He’s a young guy who has a lot of potential.”Tuilagi is unlikely to be involved on Saturday as he continues his battle for full fitness, but the Leicester centre remains with the squad and has yet to be officially ruled out against Australia.“Manu trained very hard this morning (Tuesday) and has another session today. He’s working really hard to get as fit as possible, so we’ll keep assessing him,” Borthwick said.Credit: talkSPORT via: USAHint SportsCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp.You could equally email your stories or articles to admin@ghanaxtra.com and we'll surely put them online",England rugby news: Chris Ashton ruled out of final Autumn International against Australia with calf injury,Frank A.

Suarez found his forward partner with a backheeled through-ball, that beat three Betis players, which was then turned in by the Argentine.It was 3-0 after the break when Suarez, who missed two earlier chances, drove forward from 25 yards out before slotting past Lopez.Substitute Loren pulled a goal back with a sidefoot strike past the reach of goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, before Messi completed his hat-trick with a stunning effort that had the home support rise to their feet and applaud.Barcelona now have 66 points from 28 games.

This is just to take money from the Government.” But in a sudden u-turn, the underfire and apologetic Minister has described his comment as an unconcious slip and apologised unreservedly. “I unreservedly retract and aoplogise sincerely for this unfortunate statement and pray all and sundry to forgive me on this score.”According to him, his comment was directed at some farmers in the region and not directed at all the people in the region as been purported.He added that he considers himself a Dagomba having lived in the region for 27 years and so there is no way he could do any thing to denigrate them .

“Yes, I lived in Northern Region for 27 years and had all my formative years there. I often pride myself as a Dagomba and identify with them at all times. I cannot there consciously spite them.“Based on my past experience on Farmer Based projects, I meant to say some farmers can be difficult as it is with all Regions.”Call our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to info@ghanaxtra.com and we'll surely put them online",Under Fire Deputy Agric Minister Apologises For Offensive Comment Against Northerners,ABOAGYE FRANK,2017/08

The league was once known for its hard tackles and physical play but now, largely thanks to players like Silva, it is as recognised for the technical brilliance of the players that play in it.“A wonderful football player and a charming boy,” said Gary Lineker in words that are as close to the general consensus as you’ll find, while Gary Neville said that he is “the best example of what a footballer should be”.“You can see his quality from the time he has spent in the Premier League,” Pep Guardiola said. “He is one of few players who can play in a pocket and he’s a master at attacking tight spaces.”The praise of Silva is nothing new, and a former City boss spoke highly of him too.“Silva is on the same level as Xavi and Andres Iniesta,” said Roberto Mancini, the Spaniard’s coach when he arrived in Manchester as a World Cup winner in 2010.“I was living with my parents, they were separating and it was the right time to leave Spain,” Silva himself said.There is an argument to say that Silva is the best Premier League player of all time”Graeme Souness, former Liverpool player and managerThe player said goodbye to Valencia and helped Manchester City‘s transition to speed up, becoming a key cog at the Etihad Stadium.“He’s at the top with Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Paul Scholes,” explained Thierry Henry, while Chris Sutton agrees with the comparison to the former Manchester United great, saying “they’re not the centre of attention, but they focus on being better than the rest.”Silva reminds me of Scholes: they’re not the centre of attention, but they focus on being better than the rest.”Chris Sutton, former Blackburn Rovers strikerPass by pass, Silva has spent nine seasons at City, paving the way for the existence of this current team.He has 77 assists in England and only Cesc Fabregas (111) has more among Spaniards, while he has also netted 54 goals, second to only Fernando Torres‘ 85.At 33, he would easily feature in the Premier League’s top ten Spanish stars, with few having lasted as long as the Canary Islander.Silva is on the same level as Xavi and Iniesta”Roberto Mancini, former City bossIn a league once dominated by muscle and madness, the diminutive Silva dropped the leather to the ground and began to play.The three-time champion has conquered the Premier League, fighting in the mud but coming out unstained. via: USAHint SportsCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",David Silva’s Premier League,"Frank A.

My son should never be a part of my political career, and secondly, I don’t have a son who is old enough to be in a Senior High School… Suffice it to say that I have no further comment on that, my son is not old enough to be in the Senior High School.”Despite the denial, further details have emerged that prove contrary to Dr. Yaw Osei Adutwum’s earlier denial.According to a Los Angeles-based Ghanaian and a former tutor of the boy, Nana Osei Poku, the Minister’s son who is an American by birth, relocated to Ghana, when his mother decided to join his father.Justifying the decision by the Minister in a Facebook post, Nana Osei Poku who says he taught the boy Mathematics in the Middle School indicates that considering the fact that the boy had already been exposed to American curriculum from nursery to high school, a school that teaches similar curriculum was the only option.Nana Osei Poku indicates that the decision is not wrong as some Ghanaians want to portray as the boy desires to follow his father’s footsteps by attending a University in California.He argues that it is only appropriate that the boy attends a school whose curriculum is tailored or similar to the American curriculum.Read the full post belowCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",Exposed!

It is not easy at all but what we hear is assurances from the authorities but they have delivered on their promise”.A Headmaster(name withheld) in the Eastern Region decries the current situation to this portal by describing it as dire.According to him, feeding the students has now become a major headache for heads of Senior High Schools and urged authorities to intervene.Meanwhile, independent checks by this portal indicate suppliers have refused to supply foodstuffs as they have not been paid since January.The Free Senior High School (Free SHS) Policy was a government initiative introduced in September 2017.

Time was when the good money was made by the private sector and the risk takers, and not by public officials. We need to get back to those times,” he said.President Akufo-Addo made this known on Thursday, 13th July, 2017, when he launched the National Entrepreneurship and Innovations Plan (NEIP), his government’s flagship initiative, which will be the primary vehicle for providing an integrated, national support for start-ups and small businesses.The President noted that in the last 20 years, the countries that have made rapid economic strides have been the ones that have encouraged high levels of investment in entrepreneur development.
The growth of a more entrepreneurial economy, he added, has led to the creation of jobs and the acceleration of economic growth, stressing that “we can learn a lot from this global trend to develop an entrepreneurial economy, and create a conducive and business-friendly environment in our country.”To this end, the President stated that his government, in the past six months, has set about putting in place the measures needed to reduce the cost of doing business and improve the business environment.“We have begun to act on the fundamentals. We are stabilising the macro-economy and the cedi. Inflation has gone down from 15.4% in December 2016 to 12.1% in June 2017, i.e. a period of six months, the lowest in four years. The benchmark 91-day Treasury Bill (T-bill) rate was 22.8% in January last year, and has narrowed to 11.9% in June 2017, the lowest in 5 years.We have abolished a lot of taxes such as the 1% Special Import Levy, 5% VAT on Real Estate sales, 17.5% VAT on domestic airline tickets, 17.5% VAT on financial services, 17.5% VAT on selected imported medicines that are not produced locally, and have re-introduced the 3% flat VAT rate for traders,” he said.With Ghana’s economy being predominantly an SME economy, President Akufo-Addo noted that Ghana’s economic growth and development “depend on how well we nurture and support start-ups and the micro, small and medium-scale enterprises to enhance their contribution to GDP, job creation and exports.”With Micro, small, and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs) contributing about 70 per cent of Ghana’s GDP, and accounting for more than 92% of enterprises, the President said “we have to focus on the development of start-ups and small businesses by encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit as a national priority.”Describing unemployment as Ghana’s greatest problem, with more young people joining in the dispiriting search for jobs every year, President Akufo-Addo reiterated the determination of his government to “change the economic conditions in our country for the better, to ensure that young people see it as a place of opportunities, instead of the place from which they flee at the peril of their lives.”It is for this reason, he assured, that his government will “do all within our power to create an entrepreneurial climate, to enable our young people come up with creative ideas that can be developed into businesses.”Call our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp.You could equally email your stories or articles to admin@ghanaxtra.com and we'll surely put them online",President Akufo-Addo Praises Ghanaians For Their Creativity And Innovation,ABOAGYE FRANK,2017/07

Of course, our frequent fights with some major Ghanaian media houses for backlinks after they copyrighted our stories should inform you about our performance at the time.Having run a smaller blog prior to starting GhanaXtra, we knew the rules of the game and had thoroughly learnt and understood copyright laws vis-a-vis the rules on fair use. We had even engaged some content thieves in copyright battles and gotten their stories expunged by their hosts after we filed DMCA notices against them and won.We both write for passion alongside our full-time jobs and none of us is a fully trained journalist, but we hated content theft and had therefore set out to do more of exclusives with no copy and paste content on our base. We did a lot of that on politics and gossips and got the traffic we deserved over the period. However, our traffic trends shifted when we started breaking exclusives on Ghana’s coronavirus situation — from our first confirmed case on March 12 to the first and second COVID-19 casualties in Kumasi, mostly dropping full details four hours ahead of our competitors, thanks to our strong connections within the Ghanaian health industry. We were even mocked and tagged ‘hungry bloggers’ in some cases by some dumbheads but our stories became the lead through which the major news sites called authorities for confirmation, after we had gone viral.So we were doing just fine until April 10, 2020 when one of our breaking news stories went abnormally viral — and then BOOM! — we crashed for the first time.The site started blazing like wild fire with readers from different parts of the world feeding on that story and others until our resources couldn’t contain the load anymore. Yes, that single story garnered over 500,000 pageviews within two days and even more views subsequently. For businesses like ours, pageviews is everything and the product is the foreign currency you smile at when they land in your account at the end of the month — at least an assurance that you can pay writers and other operational expenses.April 2020 was an eye-opener as we learned that exclusive stories do not only sell but sell very well.I know the dream of every newswriter is to break stories, and not just stories but exclusive stories. But to do this is not an easy task as despite trusting your source, the fear that sometimes grips you before and after the publication can make you impotent for life — knowing how our people inherently despise little beginnings and would do anything to discredit you and call you names, simply because your company is young and not the familiar one.But in all this, certain things are clear, you have to be smart, be on the beat, be intuitive, be well connected, make friends everywhere across the divide and write original content with good grammar. Copy and Paste with horrible grammar will only destroy your brand, if indeed you are building one.As we write this, we are seriously looking for talented writers but even that is a struggle…..as we’ve been at it for almost two years and all we get are ‘unwilling-to-learn-copyandpasters’ who we fire after 3 days, though we offer better remuneration than some well-known portals.After hours, days, weeks, months, and years of sleepless nights with several news articles under our belt, we are not there yet but we are not giving up either. Life is a battle and we will fight until we win this battle with the little talent we have. Aluta Continua! Cheers to all struggling independent newswriters, bloggers and so on.

Juan CastroAs well as talking about his own style of play and his first few months at Arsenal in an exclusive interview with MARCA, Unai Emery has also discussed Pep Guardiola, Diego Simeone, Julen Lopetegui and Neymar.“Yes, it’s cordial. We have spoken on the phone before and I appreciate and respect him greatly. Do we have different styles? I don’t know. You can get pigeonholed in football but sometimes unfairly. I have two coaching models: Pep and Simeone and they say they’re opposites. It could be true in terms of the layout of the team, higher or lower, or how they arrive in the box. But I like things from both, then with my own personality.”“I don’t have that perception and I don’t know how it can be supported. This Arsenal have more possession than anyone, apart from Chelsea and Manchester City. And we are third top scorers [after those two]. But if one day we have space, you have to run, like what happened against Fulham [5-1 win]. I am not dogmatic. My objective is to lift the fans off their seats and there are different ways to do that. So, I don’t know why they call me defensive. Another example: one of my Sevilla sides were high scorers, we got more than 100 goals; my PSG scored many, although there you have to do so; the same was true at Lorca where I started; and in Valencia, [David] Villa scored 30 goals.”“I have followed his development closely, I study him. I like how he plays in attack to defend: good use of space, going forward, attacking in a way that means you are well positioned in defence. I analyse Pep, but also [Jose Luis] Mendilibar, Alcaraz and Javi Lopez.”“I like how he reduces the space. His team defend closer to their goal, but, for example, I faced him with Sevilla and lost 4-0. Even if you want to have the ball, they press you so well and high that they pressure you like animals and eat you. There are days when Cholo is very attacking. I think to pigeonhole him is absurd.”“He has everything at Atletico because he deserved it. One day he will have to leave and he could coach wherever he wants. Because of his personality, I see him more in Italy.” Unai Emery: After 22 years of Wenger, I had to open the windows at Arsenal“I love to. When I left Valencia, I told the president that I was more analytical of coaches than of players. I don’t have time to analyse players. I am more tactical. Wenger, for example, was more about pure football, more of a player coach. Back then, when Valencia were looking for a coach, I told the president [Manuel Llorente] that, for me, my ideal successor would be Mauricio Pochettino, who was at Espanyol. Because I analysed all the teams. Later, Poch called me to thank me. And I did it without knowing him, but I knew his Espanyol well. For that reason, I analyse teams more than players.”“You need to know when you’re speaking to the person and when you’re speaking to the player. The last day when I was leaving Paris, I had the pleasure of him coming to say goodbye and giving me a hug and that, at a human level, I valued.”“In football that concept doesn’t exist, this sport is very disloyal. You have to know where you are, and there is no justice here. As coaches we have to learn these extremes. I try to get on with that.”“I have no idea. I think the fans would applaud me, but I don’t know how to interpret if they love me. I left Lorca and when I returned with Almeria, I noticed it was 50-50. When I went back to Almeria, the same, because when you leave places, people don’t accept it. It’s like when a girlfriend leaves you. She tells you: ‘you are very nice’. Yes, but she leaves you. You are hurt and that happens to fans. For that reason, it’s better to leave places where you’re not thrown out. At PSG? I don’t know. I think the fans might not want you to continue but the people at the club appreciate me. I’m sure. And the same at Sevilla. From inside they always tell me how much they love me [laughs]. But all I look for is respect, and if they love me, even better. That’s what I achieved at every club.”Credit: Marca via: USAHint SportsCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp.You could equally email your stories or articles to admin@ghanaxtra.com and we'll surely put them online","Emery discusses Guardiola, Simeone, Neymar and recommending Pochettino to Valencia",Frank A.

That seems to be the situation now as both contenders in the Liberian elections have all sought solace in the Lord.Ahead of the run off scheduled for November 17, former footballer and one of the contenders, George Weah on Sunday visited powerful Nigerian televangelist, T.B Joshua.Weah had rushed to T.B Joshua’s Synagogue Church of All Nations in Lagos to seek spiritual help in becoming victorious in an election many experts have predicted to be difficult to call.Addressing the ex-footballer, T.B Joshua noted for his spiritual prowess said it is important to seek the face of God since He is the final decider in all matters.

 “My brother is here because he loves his country and wants to know God’s choice for his country. He wants to hear God’s opinion about his country. He is not here to impose himself. What does God say about his country, Liberia?“Without corresponding power, we cannot pray to God. We cannot pray against God’s will. God’s choice is our choice. If I am a true man of God, I must hear from God. Every step we take, every movement and action – intimation comes first. There must be a suggestion from the Spirit to move before we move.”Interestingly and coincidentally, the man of revealed during the service that Weah’s other contestant, Vice President Joseph Boakai has also served notice that he plans to visit the man of God.But the powerful man of God was quick to add that he is just a vessel who relays only what God reveals.“I am happy that our Vice President also sent an email that he would like to meet me. God’s opinion is what we should seek in our country. God is the Answer, the Final.” Both Vice President Joseph Boakai  and George Weah will battle it out in the final battle of the presidential run-off on November 17.The runoff follows the inability of any candidate to secure more than 50%  of total votes cast to be declared winner as stipulated by the Liberian constitution.In the results released by the country’s electoral body in the October 10 election, Weah won 39 percent of votes cast while Boakai got 29 percent.

Just as we were about to go up the escalator, we ran in Hon Atta Akyea who enquired what we were doing in Parliament at that time.We replied that we had arrived for sitting the next day! You needed to see the shock on his face as he walked away. He apparently notified his side and made them rush to Parliament at 4am to sleep in the chamber.Well, we were in bed getting our beauty sleep at that time as we had agreed to get to the Chamber at 10am. There was no need for a rush or anything. We had won the battle and the war. We had elected the Speaker we wanted.

Out of the positions, three of them, that is the Chairman, the Secretary and the Zongo Caucus Coordinator will not be contested.The lack of competition for the positions of Chairman and Secretary seems to have taken some bit of shine from the race but with Opoku Mensah Prince (Portuphy) bent on uprooting the almighty Mohamed Siedu (Maha) as the organizer, all eyes will  surely be on the conference in the Brong Ahafo region.Another portfolio that all political watchers will be keeping a close eye on  is the position of the Regional Communication Officer which is being contested between Hon. Apraku Lartey and Charles Akowuah Tuffour.Ahead of the elections, a research organisation, INTEGRITY NETWORK, has released a report detailing the profiles of all the 45 apirants.The report does not only look at the identity of the various aspirants but it also contains a comprehenssive assessment of their roles to party activism and their likely chances in the delegates’ congress.According to the Executive Director of Integrity Network, Mr Osei Henry, this report is based on an initial research conducted between 27th July and 10th August, 2018.He reveals that the organisation will in the coming days release the second part of the report which will contain specifics in terms of projected percentages each candidate is expected to get in the delegates congress.The de facto chairman of the party from hence is Hon. Kwadwo Nyamekye Marfo. This sterns from the fact that he is going into the contest unopposed. Hon. Nyamekye Marfo is the incumbent Vice Chairman of the party in the region and will from 1st September 2018, be handed over the mantle by Chairman Atuahene who has honorably paid his dues to the party.Hon. Kwadwo Nyamekye Marfo brings some dignity to the leadership front of the party in the region. He comes to the chairmanship position as a very decorated and experienced politician. From the cadre stock of the party, he rose through the rank and file of the party to become the District Chief Executive officer of Sunyani, Regional Minister for Brong Ahafo and an Ambassador to Algeria in the last NDC administration.Most delegates say that his humility is beyond human understanding. They say that he has an impeccable human relation and is able to mingle with ordinary people so calmly. Most delegates feel that it would have been a waste of time, energy and resources for anyone who would have contested him.Indeed, with Hon. Nyamekye Marfo as the chairman of the National Democratic Congress in the region, the New Patriotic Party had to prepare for a diplomatic warfare strategy come 2020 here in the Brong Ahafo Region.The race for the vice chairmanship position is ably contested by three candidates for which two of them will be elected to the position as vice chairpersons. They are Mr. Kwadwo Takyi-Arhin of Techiman South Constituency known in football circles as Thunder.He is the incumbent Regional Youth Organizer and a very popular football administrator, Alhaji Nasiru Yusifu Farara the immediate past chairman of Techiman South constituency and a GPRTU secretary, and Alhaji Ibrahim Gariba a former Vice Chairman of Wenchi constituency.This is an open battle ground with no clear leader in the race for now. Takyi Arhin is the popular among the aspirants but suffers from an incumbency disadvantage. Most of our respondents feel that he is more dedicated to football than party activities. Notwithstanding that, he is a giant in the party with huge connection and the dynamics are likely to favour him.Alhaji Nasiru Yusif Farara, a cadre, who seeks elevation from constituency chairman to a regional vice chairmanship position, comes to the race as an experienced politician and organizational leader.However, the party’s performance in the 2016 election in Techiman and the circumstances leading to his stepping down in the contest for the constituency chairmanship race is likely to affect his chances if not managed well.Alhaji Ibrahim Garibah is the surprise candidate here. He is a known financier of the party and most delegates feel he is resourceful which will inure to the advantage of the party organisation especially in opposition. As vice chairman of Wenchi, the delegates hardly blame him for the misfortunes of the party in the 2016 general elections.The chief scribe’s portfolio of the great Akatamanso party in the Brong Ahafo Region is under the able leadership of Dennis Yeboah Twumasi of Sunyani West Constituency popularly called Redman as a result of his light skin pigmentation.Dennis Yeboah Twumasi, is the incumbent regional secretary of the party is honoured by the NDC faithfuls for his sacrifices and services to the party as an unopposed candidate for the position of Regional Secretary.When asked why he was unopposed, almost all the respondents would start like “hard work pays”. Most of the delegates our team spoke to say he is a workaholic and the heartbeat of the party in the region. Delegates see him as the epitome of loyalty, commitment and dedication to the course of Akatamanso movement.Candidates in contention to ably deputize Mr. Dennis Yeboah Twumasi for the administration of the regional secretariat of the party are Mohammed Shamsudeen of Atebubu Amanten Constituency who is a member of the regional communication team and a special aid to the former Member of Parliament, Sanja Nanja, Donkor Isaac of Kintampo Constituency and a member of the NDC regional communication team, and Mohammed Abdul Razak (affectionately called Chachas) of Sunyani East Constituency and also a member of the regional communication team.At the time of our initial rounds of calls, most of the delegates said they were yet to meet with the aspirants. However, the delegates who affirmatively confirmed knowledge of the aspirants prowess placed Abdul Razak ahead of the others. They describe him as an eloquently energetic young man.In the race for the regional organizer of the party, there are two candidates who are seeking to prevent the re-election of the incumbent organizer, Mohammed Seidu of Sunyani East Constituency and affectionately called Maha. These two contenders are Akwasi Lampo a former Constituency Organizer, and Opoku Mensah Prince of Techiman South Constituency who is called Junior Kofi Portuphy as a result of his connection and links with the National Chairman of the Party.Our research revealed that, all the aspirants have some degree of presence in the various constituencies. Mr. Mohammed Seidu is very popular among the delegates as compared to Mr.Opoku Mensah Prince and Akwasi Lampo. Mr. Mohammed Seidu stands as the overwhelming favourite to retain his position. Most delegates are of the belief that he is their best bet to organize the party in opposition.This assertion is based on the fact that he has enormous experience when it comes to mobilization of the grassroots. Others are of the notion that if it was not for Maha the party would have collapsed.One particular delegate even said that,it will be a doom for the party in the region if he is ousted because of the numerous functions he plays in the party.However, there seems to be a grand scheme by certain individuals both internally and externally to get him out in order to reduce his seemingly absolute control of the party in the region. The only blemish to the agenda ‘Retain Maha’ is that some grassroots members feel that he amassed a lot of wealth to himself to the neglect of party loyalists. But this allegation falls flat against the overwhelming evidence of his financial support to the party activities and individual members especially those of the zongo communities.On the other two organizer hopefuls, Opoku Mensah Prince seems more threatening to the bid to retain MAHA as compared to that of Akwasi Lampo. He leads the smear campaign against the agenda retain MAHA. These notwithstanding, the general consensus among most delegates is the need for the two to bide their time as the party needs tried and tested hands for party organization and mobilization especially as they find themselves in opposition.The battle for the office of the deputy organizer is an open race for all three contending aspirants to grab as a result of the dynamics at play here. The position is ably contested by Charles Asiedu of Tain Constituency who is the least known in the race but he comes into the contest with the advantage of a giant political godfather General Asiedu Nketia, Abdul Fatau Abass of Wenchi Constituency comes into the race with the experience from being a constituency organizer, and Gabriel Kwarteng of Sunyani East Constituency popularly called Angel Gabriel is the vice chairman of the Regular Callers Association in the region and the most popular among the delegates with huge media presence.Our initial findings, however, show that the race is more pronounced between Abdul Fatau Abass and Gabriel Kwarteng who contested the same portfolio and lost slightly the in 2014.The treasurer position is being contested by incumbent Deputy Regional Treasurer Mr Abonkrah Manu Joseph, a Cadre from Pru, and Mr Gapson Kofi Raphael a party activist in the Far East and a regional communication team member and from the Atebubu Amantin Constituency.Our research shows that Mr Abonkrah who seeks the endorsement of the delegates to become the substantive is the overwhelming favourite to become the next regional treasurer of the party for the Brong Ahafo Region. The reasons given by most delegates to back this claim point to the fact that Mr Abonkrah has gained substantial experience from serving as deputy treasurer. They believe by voting for him is a reward for his humility, hard work, loyalty and unflinching commitment to the course of the party.On the part of Mr. Gapson Raphael who is more visible on the various social media platforms, the delegates feel that he has the competencies to be the next financial officer of the party but are not sure if his time is now. Another section of the kingmakers of the party claim that by ignoring Mr Abonkrah as the party’s next treasurer will serve as a disincentive to party loyalists from staying committed to the party’s course. However, Raphael seems to enjoy some support from the Far East where the smear campaign against Mr. Abonkrah for his association with MAHA is more pronounced and he is likely to give Abonkrah a run for his money.The race to take over from Mr. Abonkrah Manu Joseph as the deputy regional treasurer are Ayomah Moro, a former Deputy Youth Organizer and Regional Coordinator of the Youth Employment Agency, Suaka Peter Lonyian a member of the Regional Communication Team, a prolific writer and a disappointed Constituency Deputy Secretary, and Magyina Kwasi a member of the Regional Communication Team, secretary to the Regular Callers Association and also a disappointed Constituency Youth Organizer. Surprisingly, they are all from the Sunyani East Constituency.Ayomah Moro is the popular among the aspirants and leads the race to become the next Deputy Treasurer. However, his track record as the Youth Employment Coordinator seems to create some disaffection for his bid.Suaka Peter comes to the race as a fine gentleman with great advantage of having a Master of Science Degree in Development Management from the University of Development Studies to complement whosoever is elected the Treasurer.Magyina Kwasi is a very popular grassroots person and a TEIN activist and mostly heard on radio defending the party. Most delegates feel he is very committed and loyal to the course of the party.The newly created communication officer position of the party is one of the keenly contested positions in this year’s regional elections. There will be three individuals who will be vying to become the first communication officer of the region.These aspirants are Hon. Apraku Lartey, the immediate past District Chief Executive of Tano North and the parliamentary aspirant for the party in the 2016 general election for the same constituency, Mr. Moro Zorngo of Wenchi Constituency and Mr Charles Akowuah Tuffour a popular communicator of the party. This competition is a two horse race between Mr Akowuah and Hon Apraku Lartey.Most delegates our researchers interviewed said that Akowuah stands the chance of becoming the first ever regional communication officer of the party.They believe that he is calm but very smart when discussing issues on radio.They are of the assertion that his communication on party issues in the media circles is better than his close contender Hon.Apraku. Others are also of the view that the smear campaign of tagging him as an NPP member by his opponents has worked to his advantage as he has justified himself as a loyal and committed member to the agenda 2020 course of the party.Hon.Apraku Lartey has a very good track record as DCE of Tano North and lost narrowly to Freda Prempeh of the NPP.  As a long standing member of the regional communication team, Hon. Apraku Lartey comes to the race as an experienced politician with sound knowledge in financial administration and rich experience in local government.His supporters call him “Akoraa Nyame” and they claim that he made the district capital of Tano North, Duankwanta, a “Small London”. With resources advantage and connections, Hon. Apraku Lartey is tipped to win if he is able to manage the seemingly dire relationship with executive members of the Ahafo groupings.On Mr.Moro Zongo,our research revealed that, he had little presence among the grassroots. He is more vibrant in the Bono East but even there Akowuah is stronger.Whosoever wins as the communication officer for the party is to have a very strong partner to face the vociferous NPP communication team in the person of Eric Adjei, a law student. A known and active regional communication team member, Eric Adjei is one of the fire brands in the communication team of the party and faces little or no competition from his only contender Amadu Eben Awulai.Most of the delegates our team spoke to said they do not know Adamu Eben Awulai and he is yet to visit their constituencies. We are highly convinced that Mr. Awulai is in this race to promote a certain agenda.Barring any last minute changes, we believe that Eric Adjei is in for massive and overwhelming endorsement.The women wing of the party promises to be one of the portfolios in serious contention. The incumbent Women Organizer Florence Aning a queen mother in the Dormaa Traditional Area and popularly known as Nana Hemaa faces a stiff opposition two giants of the the women front of the party in the region. Nana Hemaa enjoys some high level of incumbency advantage, however, she also suffers from issues raised by her opponents for role she played in the run up to the 2016 general elections.Hon. Grace Boakye is former Member of Parliament for Tano South and former regional coordinator of the School Feeding Programme. Hon. Grace Boakye is very popular among the women front across the region for her role as a team leader of the selected women that went across the region to sensitize the women of the region. Most of the delegates feel she has a very good message.Hon. Agnes Kusi has the highest chance to upset the incumbent. She is the former District Chief Executive of Sunyani West Constituency. Most delegates our team spoke to said she is their choice and the best bet for election 2020. She is said to be very vibrant with very good human relation.The deputy women organizer position is been contested by six energetic party activist of the NDC women front in the region for which two of the will be elected to assist the main women organizer.They are Deborah Narh of Sunyani East Constituency and a former deputy women organizer, Fati Abubakar of Berekum East, Georgina Puopiel an immediate past deputy women organizer, Ntene Ayisha of Sunyani East also an immediate past deputy women organizer, Evelyn Adarkwah-Frema popularly called Armatel is a former chairperson and also from the Sunyani East Constituency, Amponsah Felicity is a former treasurer of the party.According to our initial round of interviews, Hadjia Ntene Ayisha is the overwhelming favorite among the contenders. However, there is high level of competition between the other five aspirants.The Youth organizer position is keenly contested between four energetic young men. These aspirants are Thomas Warlanyo Tsekpo popularly known as Efo and Bilal Mauzu Sulemana both of the communication department of the party. The rest are Ayaaba John who happens to be the current deputy youth organizer and Sulemana Alhassan popularly called Ashavin is also a communication team member and an active member of the youth wing of the party.Ayaaba John and Thomas Warlanyo Tsekpo lead the pack in terms of strong presence in the various constituencies. Ayaaba John seems to have slight edge over the other candidates because of incumbency advantage. Most delegates feel that these two individuals are easily accessible, grassroots persons and good orators who can organize the youth for victory in 2020.Bilal Sulemana who is making his second bid to serve from the youth front is considered as a dark horse in this race and poses a serious threat to the leading contenders as some of the delegates believe that he has the capabilities to lead the youth wing of the party. Majority of the delegates said they were yet to meet or speak to Sulemana Alhassan.Accessibility, hardworking, dedication, resourcefulness, oratory skills, and humility among others are traits delegates said they will consider before voting for an individual to lead the youth wing of the party.There are eight energetic young men in the race for the position of deputy youth organizer for which two will be elected to support the youth organizer for the mobilization of the youth front of the party.We of Integrity Network are highly surprised about the sheer number of contenders for this portfolio and would advise that going forward the elections committee of the party should learn to down size the numbers to get the best for the delegates.They are Eric Yaw Amponsah also known as Hon. Shoe is an incumbent deputy youth organizer and seeking reelection, Obeng Agyenim Boateng is from the Atebubu Amantin Constituency, a regional communication team member and a TEIN activist, Gilbert Nondo Gbolo of Sunyani East Constituency is a well known regional communication team member and highly connected with national leaders of the party, and Owusu Ababio Nkrumah of Asutifi North Constituency who contested for the 2015 parliamentary primaries.The rest are Nasir Nuhu Asura and Nicholas Saddari all of Sunyani East Constituency, Rashid Ahmed of Berekum, and Moses Kofi Woli of Jaman North Constituency who is a regional communication team member responsible with focus on social media.Our initial findings, however, show that the race is more pronounced between Abdul Fatau Abass and Gabriel Kwarteng who contested the same portfolio and lost slightly the in 2014.The treasurer position is being contested by incumbent Deputy Regional Treasurer Mr Abonkrah Manu Joseph, a Cadre from Pru, and Mr Gapson Kofi Raphael a party activist in the Far East and a regional communication team member and from the Atebubu Amantin Constituency.Our research shows that Mr Abonkrah who seeks the endorsement of the delegates to become the substantive is the overwhelming favourite to become the next regional treasurer of the party for the Brong Ahafo Region.The reasons given by most delegates to back this claim point to the fact that Mr Abonkrah has gained substantial experience from serving as deputy treasurer. They believe by voting for him is a reward for his humility, hard work, loyalty and unflinching commitment to the course of the party.On the part of Mr. Gapson Raphael who is more visible on the various social media platforms, the delegates feel that he has the competencies to be the next financial officer of the party but are not sure if his time is now.Another section of the kingmakers of the party claim that by ignoring Mr Abonkrah as the party’s next treasurer will serve as a disincentive to party loyalists from staying committed to the party’s course.However, Raphael seems to enjoy some support from the Far East where the smear campaign against Mr. Abonkrah for his association with MAHA is more pronounced and he is likely to give Abonkrah a run for his money.The race to take over from Mr. Abonkrah Manu Joseph as the deputy regional treasurer are Ayomah Moro, a former Deputy Youth Organizer and Regional Coordinator of the Youth Employment Agency, Suaka Peter Lonyian a member of the Regional Communication Team, a prolific writer and a disappointed Constituency Deputy Secretary, and Magyina Kwasi a member of the Regional Communication Team, secretary to the Regular Callers Association and also a disappointed Constituency Youth Organizer. Surprisingly, they are all from the Sunyani East Constituency.Ayomah Moro is the popular among the aspirants and leads the race to become the next Deputy Treasurer. However, his track record as the Youth Employment Coordinator seems to create some disaffection for his bid.Suaka Peter comes to the race as a fine gentleman with great advantage of having a Master of Science Degree in Development Management from the University of Development Studies to complement whosoever is elected the Treasurer.Magyina Kwasi is a very popular grassroots person and a TEIN activist and mostly heard on radio defending the party. Most delegates feel he is very committed and loyal to the course of the party.The newly created communication officer position of the party is one of the keenly contested positions in this year’s regional elections. There will be three individuals who will be vying to become the first communication officer of the region.These aspirants are Hon. Apraku Lartey, the immediate past District Chief Executive of Tano North and the parliamentary aspirant for the party in the 2016 general election for the same constituency, Mr. Moro Zorngo of Wenchi Constituency and Mr Charles Akowuah Tuffour a popular communicator of the party. This competition is a two horse race between Mr Akowuah and Hon Apraku Lartey.Most delegates our researchers interviewed said that Akowuah stands the chance of becoming the first ever regional communication officer of the party.They believe that he is calm but very smart when discussing issues on radio.They are of the assertion that his communication on party issues in the media circles is better than his close contender Hon.Apraku. Others are also of the view that the smear campaign of tagging him as an NPP member by his opponents has worked to his advantage as he has justified himself as a loyal and committed member to the agenda 2020 course of the party.Hon.Apraku Lartey has a very good track record as DCE of Tano North and lost narrowly to Freda Prempeh of the NPP.  As a long standing member of the regional communication team, Hon. Apraku Lartey comes to the race as an experienced politician with sound knowledge in financial administration and rich experience in local government.His supporters call him “Akoraa Nyame” and they claim that he made the district capital of Tano North, Duankwanta, a “Small London”. With resources advantage and connections, Hon. Apraku Lartey is tipped to win if he is able to manage the seemingly dire relationship with executive members of the Ahafo groupings.On Mr.Moro Zongo,our research revealed that, he had little presence among the grassroots.

The rest would need to increase their efforts tremendously in order to cause some upset.Alhaji Baba Awudu Gausu is the incumbent and delegates feels he was not contested because of his hard work, commitment, loyalty to the course of the great Akatamanso party.

It is so sad what we are doing. If it has to come to me to exhume the body and take it to a proper place I am prepared to do it.“If the state is not ready to take care of it we would have to advise ourselves.”John Evans Atta Mills served as President of Ghana from 2009 to 2012.

The ruthlessness of his pen and lens knows no bound.But the journalist in recent times has come under the radar of supporters of the NPP following his recent documentary titled ‘Militia in the Heart of the Nation’. The documentary looks to have stepped on many toes creating a lot of enemies for him.The young international relations and security expert was the toast of many Ghanaians. His eloquence and soft demeanor on radio and television won him many friends from all angles. Interestingly, the young chap is now in the black books of many Ghanaians.He has attracted many enemies to himself after he rose to the defense of disgraced former GFA boss, Mr. Kwesi Nyantakyi in the wake of the Number 12 video.He has also incurred the wrath of the public after he started championing Toxic Masculinity and sought to justify why a man may batter an insolent and insulting wife.If you think Manasseh Azure is the most hated Multimedia journalist in 2019  then wait as another Multimedia journalist, Omanhene Kwabena Asante looks to be competing with him for the baton.The host of Badwam on Adom has suddenly become the  “bad boy” of many NDC sympathisers after he went ballistic and described a public lecture by the NDC as “Concert Party.”Call our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to info@ghanaxtra.com and we'll surely put them online",Meet The 5 Most Hated Ghanaians In 2019,Frank A.

The MCE claimed some Togolese had come to Ghana to register to vote. He went on to say he personally spoke Ewe to the supposed Togolese and the man did not understand Ewe so and run into the bush after he had been exposed.Sanda asked him how it was possible for the man to escape, why the police, soldiers, national security and BNI officers who were with the MCE and the regional minister on the tour of the polling centres did not arrest this man but allowed him to run away.The MCE’s answer was that he (the MCE) and the regional minister did not meet this man themselves. He said their boys were those who encountered him and later reported to him. “And by the time they were giving this report to us, the person had already fled into the bush and entered into Togo.”“But you just said you spoke Ewe to him yourself?” Sanda reminded him.The MCE claimed he spoke to the man 100 metres away.“You must have been shouting then?” said Sanda.The MCE and the NPP should just leave the people of Ketu South and the Volta Region alone. It is a shame to keep on lying and maligning a group of people just because they don’t vote for your party. Leave them alone. They have not committed any crime.

Governing council for every public institution is key.“I am happy that today, UTAG has found it feet to call on government to reconstitute governing councils with the view if this is not done, it will affect academic work. I agree with UTAG it’s all good for our rule of law, it is for us to develop our laws and it is nothing personal.”Earlier on Monday, the court had thrown out a preliminary legal objection filed by the University describing the lawsuit as incompetent and also  argued that the complaint had no locus in initiating the action because he had failed to demonstrate that he had any personal interest or he would suffer any personal injuries by any action by the UEW.Background Mr Supi Kofi Kwayera, a former Assembly Member for Donkoryiem, in Winneba  in May this year filed a suit challenging the continuous stay in office of the Governing Council of UEW as their two two-year terms had expired in November 2013.Mr Supi argued that their continuous stay in office was in contradiction to Section 8 of the University of Education, Winneba Act (Act 672).The suit also challenged the appointment of certain officers such as the Vice- Chancellor, the Registrar and the Chief Finance Officer.Call our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online","UEW Vice-Chancellor, Professor Mawutor Avoke Ordered To Step Aside",ABOAGYE FRANK,2017/07

The deal ties Solskjaer – who will hold a press conference this afternoon – to the club until June 2022.Solskjaer was not considered a serious candidate for the post when he initially took over, with Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino the front-runner for the job.But a run of 14 wins from 19 matches, which have helped propel United back into contention for a top-four finish and into the Champions League quarter-finals, coupled with his attempts to restore the club’s DNA on and off the field, persuaded the board that he was the right man to take them forward.As well as the confidence and feelgood factor Solskjaer has restored, and the return to more attack-minded football, United’s hierarchy have been encouraged by the development and improvement in a short space of time of players who were stagnating or regressing under Mourinho, as well as the promotion of a number of academy graduates.“From the first day I arrived, I felt at home at this special club,” said Solskjær. “It was an honour to be a Manchester United player, and then to start my coaching career here.This is the job that I always dreamed of doing and I’m beyond excited to have the chance to lead the club long-term and hopefully deliver the continued success that our amazing fans deserve.”Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman, said Solskjaer had a “deep understanding of the culture of the club” that proved an influential factor behind his appointment. Mourinho was often criticised for failing to properly understand United’s philosophy.“Since coming in as caretaker manager in December, the results Ole has delivered speak for themselves,” Woodward said.“More than just performances and results, Ole brings a wealth of experience, both as a player and as a coach, coupled with a desire to give young players their chance and a deep understanding of the culture of the club.“This all means that he is the right person to take Manchester United forward. I want to thank Ole and the coaching team for everything they have done so far and congratulate him on this richly deserved appointment. The fans and everyone at the club are behind him as he looks to take us where we need to be and build the next stage of our history.”Credit: TelegraphCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to info@ghanaxtra.com and we'll surely put them onlineLog in to leave a comment ",Ole Gunnar Solskjaer Confirmed As Permanent Manchester United Manager On Three-Year Contract,GhanaXtra,2019/03

This includes fueling of vehicles, security, clerical staff, stationery, hosting of local and foreign guests and all such expenditures.The distinction must be made, however, that this is separate from allowances payable to spouses of the President, Vice President, former Presidents, former Vice Presidents and former Heads of State.In the first Government of the 4th Republic (the Rawlings Administration), some recommendations were made to provide allowances to the spouses of the President and Vice President and additionally, as a gesture of reconciling with our past, the spouses of former Presidents and Heads of State.Since this convention was established by the Rawlings administration, issues in respect of allowances of the spouses of the President and Vice President and spouses of former Presidents and Heads of State have largely been handled administratively and provided for under the budget of the Office of the President.This week, a raging issue that has generated passionate debate among many Ghanaians, both on social media and in the traditional media space – TV and Radio – has been in respect of a report, confirmed by Government that the spouses of President Nana Akufo-Addo and Vice President Dr. Mahamadu Bawumia are to be placed on a monthly salary at the level of a Cabinet Minister.We are told that the 7th Parliament of the Republic of Ghana, which was dissolved at midnight of January 6, 2021, approved the recommendation in the Report of the Presidential Committee on Emoluments for Article 71 Office Holders (January 2017 to December 2020), chaired by Professor Yaa Ntiamoa-Baidu.The news, particularly at this time of austerity, has generated some level of outrage among the populace, and I can understand the anger of those opposing the recommendation of the Ntiamoa-Baidu Committee and its subsequent approval by parliament.It should be made clear, also, that the recommendation in respect of spouses in the Ntiamoa-Baidu Committee report, which covers the years January 7, 2017 to January 6, 2021, is solely in respect of the Spouses of President Akufo-Addo and Vice President Bawumia.The challenge, however, is that the spouses of the President and Vice President are not captured among Article 71 Office Holders and, therefore, there is no legal or constitutional basis for it.It should be noted that the recommended salaries for the Spouses in the Ntiamoa-Baidu report are captured as part of the emoluments of the President and the Vice President. This seems like an attempt to sneak the First and Second Ladies into the article 71 office holders’ group. This is clearly problematic.Indeed, the Ntiamoa-Baidu Committee rightly makes the case on page 51 of its report as follows: “The Committee notes that neither Article 71 nor any of the provisions in the Constitution bestows benefits on spouses of Presidents and Vice Presidents. Similarly, no legislation mentions what the State should provide for spouses of Presidents and Vice Presidents.”The question then is: if the Committee recognises the above, and therefore appreciates that there can be no legal or constitutional basis for seeking to bestow any such benefits on the spouses of the President and Vice President (VP), why then did it proceed to provide for the payment of monthly salaries pegged at the level of a Cabinet Minister to both the First Lady and wife of the VP who served in the period 2017 to 2020, even if it was conveniently enveloped as part of the emoluments of the President and Vice President?And why did Parliament also approve, as has been reported, this recommendation without a review?Article 71 is an entrenched clause in the 1992 Constitution and nothing short of a referendum can be used to amend or vary that clause as per article 290 of the Constitution. The Committee, and indeed the Government, cannot use a short-cut to circumvent well laid-out constitutional rules.Furthermore, pegging their salaries at the level of a Cabinet Minister suggests that all conditions and benefits that come with the Committee’s recommendation for a Cabinet Minister will likely apply. This recommendation, therefore, is inappropriate and its approval, if true, is unfortunate.As earlier mentioned, it is a fact that over the years, successive governments have continued the convention of providing the offices of the First Lady and Second Lady with allowances. The practice has included the payment of quarterly allowances to the surviving spouses of former Presidents, former Vice Presidents and former Heads of State, which practice has been appreciated by the beneficiaries as a token from the State.Anyhow, if Government wishes to formalize these allowances, it must bring some form of enabling legislation to back these payments, noting that best practice in other democracies do not support payment of salaries to spouses of office holders.This debate also brings back to the fore my oft-repeated position that the recommendation for the establishment of an Independent Emoluments Commission must be carried through.I believe that instead of trying to unconstitutionally enlarge the scope of Article 71 office holders for the purposes of determining emoluments, the Government must as a matter of urgency set up the Independent Emoluments Commission.To provide some background, the establishment of an Independent Emoluments Commission (IEC) was a recommendation of the Constitution Review Commission in 2011. It was endorsed in the Government’s White Paper and both the Edu-Bandoh and Ntiamoa-Baidu Committees made a case for its urgent establishment. In fact, I am on record to have championed this position.If this proposed Independent Emoluments Committee is established, the Commission will not only stop the practice of setting up a new emoluments committee every four years and coming up with varying recommendations but will ensure that salary administration in Ghana is rationalized and equity is brought into the system.To emphasise this point, let me share a recommendation from the Edu-Bandoh Committee Report: ​​“The future of public sector salary regimes needs to be built on the guiding principles outlined in this report in determining and making recommendations on the emoluments of Article 71 Office Holders for 2013 – 2017. It is important that salary adjustments of all public sector workers take into account such principles as equity and fairness, productivity, cost of living, motivation, ability to pay, as well as accountability, among others. The future of fixing salaries of office holders in the Ghanaian public sector will be strengthened if the guiding principles are upheld in all sectors for the realization of equity and fairness in the public sector salary administration.”The times are dire, and the economy is under severe stress. Any attempt to broaden the scope and for that matter turn the spouses of the President and VP into permanent office holders, in addition to the support provided to their offices, would appear unreasonable.I recall that I entered the 4th Republican Parliament in the same year as President Nana Akufo-Addo. As a young MP, I remember we debated an amendment to the Assets Declaration Law to expand its ambit. One of the groups targeted for addition was spouses of public office holders including the President, Vice President, Ministers among others.Leading those who vehemently opposed the inclusion of spouses was President Akufo-Addo. I remember one of the main thrusts of his argument was that a spouse could not have known that their partner would end up in high office at the time they got married. It would therefore be unfair to subject them to the hazards of an assets declaration regime (it would be in the Hansard somewhere).Have the chickens come home to roost? A spouse may not have known that their partner would end up in high office at the time of marriage, so would it not be unfair to bestow upon them salaries as part of their husband’s emoluments in office?Finally, it has also been indicated that the First and Second Ladies have been receiving allowances from 2017 to date. Should the Government choose to ignore the cries of the citizenry, as seems to be the pattern of the day, steps must then be taken to ensure that the Committee’s recommendations are not retroactively applied, leading to double payments.John Dramani Mahama

A polygamous people, the Himba girls are married off to male partners selected by their fathers once they attain puberty.You cannot ignore the red skin they have. The red colour seen on their skin is called, the otjize paste ( a combination of butterfat, omuzumba scrub and ochre) and its function is to protect their skin from the sun and insect bites.They are also guided by the belief that the colour red signifies “Earth and blood”. Rather than take their baths, the women take a smoke bath and apply aromatic resins on their skin.–Honour Is Relative–Give honour to whom it is due: This saying is applied differently in this tribe. When a visitor comes knocking, a man shows his approval and pleasure of seeing his guest by giving him the Okujepisa Omukazendu treatment.This practice literally means that his wife is given his guest to spend the night while the husband sleeps in another room. In a case where there is no available room, her husband will sleep outside.This handed down tradition has its “benefits” in the community: it reduces jealousy and fosters relationships. The woman has little or no opinion in the decision making. Submission to her husband’s demands come first. She has an option of refusing to sleep with him but has to sleep in the same room as the guest.She is also entitled to give her friends to her husband when they visit but this rarely happens.Credit: GuardianCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",The Namibian Tribe Where “Sex” Is Offered To Guests,"Frank A.

They are the University of Mines and Technology (UMaT) in Tarkwa which has become George Grant University of Mines and Technology after its name changed to honour the first President of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), and Wa Polytechnic which becomes Dr. Hilla Liman Polytechnic, named after Ghana’s president in the third republic.The change of UPSA’s name had already been hinted by President Akufo Addo when he addressed the uiversity community at its congregation last year.However, these changes can only take effect if the controversies surrounding certain clauses in the draft bill are properly ironed out and the proposed name changes are left to remain without amendment.Call our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online","UDS, UPSA, UENR, UHAS Renamed in Public University Bill","Fiifi Dixon, Editor-at-large",2019/04

Both of them had suffered serious stab wounds.They had been injured at about 21:50 GMT in Alwold Crescent where there were reports of armed youths in the street.Scotland Yard said five people – two women aged 53 and 29 and three men aged 56, 31 and 22 – have been arrested on suspicion of murder and all are in custody.The other man who was treated in hospital has since been discharged.Another teenager was stabbed to death in the same borough on Saturday while the death of a 77-year-old woman who collapsed while calling police about a burglary is being treated as manslaughter.Earlier this year it was announced the city would follow Scotland’s public health approach to help tackle violent crime. A spokesperson for the mayor said the approach was helping to tackle “the root causes of violence”.“The causes of violent crime are deeply complex and made far worse by huge government cuts over the last eight years to the police, youth services, councils and charities,” they said.Scotland Yard has also been approached for comment.

And, as the party has always done, if any such decision is taken, same will be communicated,” it said.Below is the NPP’s full statementNPP HAS NOT ISSUED ANY MEMO REGARDING THE PARTY’S 2020 PARLIAMENTARY AND PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIESThe attention of the NPP has been drawn to a supposed leaked internal memo purportedly coming from the National Steering Committee of the party announcing a new date for the party’s 2020 parliamentary and presidential primaries.The party wishes to state unequivocally that it has NOT issued any such statement/memo and there has not been any emergency National Steering Committee meeting on April 20, 2020, as claimed in the said fake statement/memo.Indeed, the last National Steering Committee meeting of the party was held on April 14, 2020, at which meeting, the party decided to suspend its primaries till further notice in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions imposed by the President pursuant to EI 64.The party has, till date, not met at any level, to review this position following the President’s decision to lift the partial lockdown imposed on some major cities in the country. And, as the party has always done, if any such decision is taken, same will be communicated to the general public through our official platforms including the party’s website: (newpatrioticparty.org)It is pretty obvious that this fake memo was authored by some political mischief makers to create disaffection for the party and the President, whose popularity has soared significantly across the globe, having demonstrated great leadership in his handling of the COVID-19 situation in Ghana.Finally, the NPP wishes to state for the avoidance of doubt that until otherwise communicated, the party’s 2020 parliamentary and presidential primaries remain suspended, and the memo being circulated on social media is FAKE and should accordingly be treated with all the disdain that it deserves.Thank you.JOHN BOADUGENERAL SECRETARYCall our Editor on 0209391902 or click here and inform us via Whatsapp. You could equally email your stories or articles to [email protected] and we'll surely put them online",NPP denies releasing new date for its primaries – Official Statement,"Fiifi Dixon, Editor-at-large",2020/04

Upon this, the mother asked the daughter to come to Ghana to see a traditional healer.Upon their visitation to the traditional priest last month, they have been told the daughter has been cursed with a flowing river that has the ovaries of the girl. So to pacify the gods of the river and that of a certain hall in KNUST, they should come with the priest of the hall who poured the libation to reverse the curse.We told the woman just one thing. She should go and look for a certain man called OBIRI DANSO who led them blindly to have their daughter to spend her entire 1st year in Katanga for Father John to take sight of her nakedness. The woman has promised to pay any amount but we are saying no.The dent they have caused our KATANGA stool can’t be appeased with any amount.The gods are really angry and we repeat again and again! No female student that stepped foot and accommodated in KATANGA for an academic year can bear a baby with flesh and blood.We are not ready today and tomorrow to reverse any curse. She should be barren forever for we don’t care.We just don’t joke with certain things in this part of our world.

That’s a matter for the judiciary,” he said.“I’m discharging my function as a parliamentarian – and what concerned me about this case was wealth, and power that comes with it, and abuse.”Lord Hain said while there had been some criticism of his decision on social media, he had received “overwhelming support – particularly from women”.By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondentPeople will remember back to the super-injunction stories of recent years, including the case of footballer Ryan Giggs. When he was named using parliamentary privilege, it was frowned upon.Parliamentarians and the judiciary alike were very concerned that this privilege should not be used to undermine the rule of law.And a great effort was made from that time to ensure that this didn’t happen again.So the judiciary is unlikely to be pleased.We have not got a constitutional crisis on our hands here, but we do have a really significant development in terms of the way in which parliamentary privilege is seen to be used in relation to court orders.Labour MP Jess Phillips said Lord Hain “did the right thing”, adding: “It was brave and I doubt he took the decision lightly.”But Barrister Hugh Tomlinson QC said the courts were the “proper institutions” for deciding the issues raised in this case.Mr Tomlinson, a founder of the Hacked Off press regulation campaign, said: “Parliament can’t trespass into areas of the courts and say we think the courts have got it wrong – and that’s what Lord Hain is effectively doing.”Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sir Philip is also a regular at London Fashion Week, seen here in 2015Former Labour Home Secretary Alan Johnson also questioned Lord Hain’s actions, telling the BBC there had to be a very good reason for a parliamentarian to breach the decision of three senior judges who had seen the evidence.Lord Evans, the new chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that “the ability to raise issues in Parliament without fear of them being brought into the court, I think is an important safeguard in our system”.There have been calls for Arcadia chairman Sir Philip to lose his knighthood if the allegations are proved to be correct, from MPs including Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable.And Labour’s Frank Field, who led condemnation of Sir Philip over the BHS pension fund scandal, said: “The charge sheet against the knighthood is growing.”Sir Philip’s recent fall from grace came after he sold the retail chain BHS for £1 in March 2015 and it then went into administration, leaving a £571m hole in its pension fund.Meanwhile, pledges to boycott Sir Philip’s stores, including Topshop, have been made on social media with the hashtag #pinknotgreen, with #feministsdontweartopshop also trending in the light of Lord Hain’s statement.Image copyright PA Image caption Sir Philip Green was knighted in 2006 for services to the retail industrySir Philip said in a statement on Thursday night that he would not comment on anything that happened in court or was said in Parliament.“To the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations,” he said.Sir Philip said he and his company, Arcadia, “take accusations and grievances from employees very seriously and in the event that one is raised, it is thoroughly investigated.“Arcadia employs more than 20,000 people and in common with many large businesses sometimes receives formal complaints from employees.“In some cases these are settled with the agreement of all parties and their legal advisers.

According to the final report by the commission, spatial issues such as travel times and distances between the regional capital and the various districts was raised 187 times during the public hearing.For example, the distance from Kajaji(the farthest of the region), Kwame Danso and Yeji to Sunyani are 292km, 239 and 264km respectively and it is only proper to ameliorate their predicament by choosing a location closer to them.In view of this, it is only fair and prudent for the capital to be situated at Atebubu a location that is centrally positioned, strategically and administratively closer to all other towns in the new region.The town is also the gateway to four other regions, that is, Ashanti region, Northern region, Eastern region and Volta region.Siting the regional capital at any place apart from the centre (Atebubu) will not only be naturally biased but will also defeat the petitioners’ own request for a region.This fact is buttressed by the petitioners’ own argument as captured by the final report of the commission that: ” The petitioners justified based on the creation of the new region on the following: need to deepen governance and bring government and its agencies and activities closer to the people…”This issue was the most dominant issue during the public hearings as it was raised 209 times representing 20.5 percent of issues raised.For the avoidance of doubt, Abuja the capital of the Federal Republic of Nigeria was chosen when the government wanted to build a new capital to replace Lagos due to its close proximity to all the regions of Nigeria.A closer look and critical analysis of the administrative map of the new region below backs the argument espoused above.Unmitigated and litigate free lands for developmentAside being centrally positioned to be easily accessed by the other Municipals and districts, Atebubu has vast lands to aid in the huge expansion that may come with the siting of the regional capital.The siting of the regional capital irrespective of where it is situated will lead to massive infrastructural drive and the influx of many people hence the need to consider an area that is not “chocked” for such a purpose.It is in this regard that the chiefs in the Atebubu Traditional Area have indicated their willingness and preparedness to release lands which are litigate free to devour developments that will come with the siting of the capital.They have also revealed their preparedness to help in any way possible to ease the pressure on the government if the capital is sited in Atebubu.One reason the petitioners eloquently put before the Justice S. A. Brobbey’s Commission of inquiry for the creation of new regions and captured same in the final report of the commission is “the need to deepen governance and bring government and its agencies and activities closer to the people, equitable and distribution of statutory funds and development projects; the enhancement of infrastructural development and access to services…”In recent times, there have been calls for the national capital to be moved from Accra to a different place due to how packed the capital looks in terms of vehicle traffic, population density and buildings.So if an opportunity has presented itself, is it not appropriate for the government to consider siting the capitals of the new regions in areas whose development can be modeled on modern developmental trends?Who sites a regional capital in an area that is already populous and developmentally chocked when rural-urban migration figures in the country are very alarming?A deviation from some of these core principles at this time will not only be morally wrong but strange and interesting.HistoryHistorically, Atebubu was the headquarters of the then Bono East Confederacy which was formed in 1893. The membership included a greater part of Nsuta and Mampong, Nkoranza, the Krachi Denteh Priest, Kwahu, Atebubu and all Guan communities around Salaga.For emphasis, the term Bono East is not of modern origin but has a historical antecedent dating back to over a century so it is only fair we revisit the history books.Atebubu was the hub of the then Bono East and so it is only fair and proper for the right thing to be done now.If a new region has been created bearing the old name then it should be copied in full, not in part.History indeed has an interesting way of repeating itself. “Obi nnim a, obi kyere( If one does not know, another man teaches him)The True definition of Bono EastWithout any shred of doubt, Atebubu and its surrounding towns like Prang, Yeji, Kwame Danso and Kajaji for decades became notoriously synonymous with the name “Bono East people” because of their location.They proudly shouldered the name even though it sometimes had some derogatory connotations (“deprived areas”).So if a new region is to be created bearing that name, it is only fair that one of the forebearers of the area(name) should be the Capital, in this case, Atebubu since it gave birth to all neighbouring districts.Effective Administration The location of Sunyani made it difficult for districts farther away to access critical services. This was because the travel distance from some of the districts to the regional capital took a whole day.It also affected government officials in the effective discharge of their duties as districts farther away from the capital also escaped proper supervision and monitoring.Page 207(45) of the commission’s own report reads: “the regional government set up, ministries, departments and agencies have difficulties in smooth administration of the region because of its vast expanse. It was practically impossible to reach some communities to undertake, supervise and monitor development projects.“When such trips are eventually undertaken personnel have to forgo considerable amount of man hours to travel with additional implication on cost. In most cases, the proposed Bono East region is adversely affected, since it has the farthest communities…”Taking a cue from this, why do you place the regional capital at say Techiman or Nkoranza which are still the farther from the other administrative towns?Won’t the regional Minister still struggle to do effective monitoring and supervision? What is the essence of creating a new region and situating the capital at some 62km or 89km from Sunyani?What benefit will it bring to the people of Kajeji and Kwame Danso if they still have to travel some 224km to access the capital?The answer to this puzzle still remains Atebubu.Gap in developmentIt is a known fact that the eastern corridor of the Brong-Ahafo region lags behind in terms of development. Areas such as Atebubu, Prang, Kwame Danso, Kajeji and Yeji lack basic social amenities compared to their other compatriots, that is, Techiman, Kintampo and Nkoranza.During the public hearings, it was the view of most residents that the creation of the new region will “bridge the spatial inequality gap and promote rapid development…”So if any region is to be created, it will only be fair and appropriate for the capital to be sited in that enclave to bridge the infrastructural gap. The proponents for the creation of the Bono East region rode on the back of infrastructural deficit to achieve that purpose so why run from it now?Yes, Atebubu has none of the so-called big institutions that some of its competitors can boast of, but let us not forget the Akan proverb that “obi nnim Obrempon ahyease” to wit “Nobody knows the beginning of a great man”.He who is full they say needs no food.The oldest district in the Bono East enclaveWhen Ghana’s former President, Kwame Nkrumah created the Brong-Ahafo region April 4, 1959, the region was divided into four districts. The regions were the Atebubu district, Sunyani district, Ahafo district and Wenchi district.The Atebubu Assembly, one of the oldest Assemblies in the Brong-Ahafo region if nothing at all should be rubbing shoulders with its peers like Sunyani.If Sunyani has risen from the ruins to be such a befitting regional capital, why can’t Atebubu too?“Monkeys they say play by sizes”, Atebubu the oldest among all Assemblies in the Bono East enclave deserves its rightful recognition.“The mouth of an elderly man is without teeth, but never without words of wisdom.”It is now or never, Atebubu for Bono East regional capital is a must and non-negotiable.
